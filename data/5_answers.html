<section id="capp-sec-0005">
<h2><a id="usec0005"></a>Domain 5: Define Operationally Excellent Architectures</h2>
<ol id="capp-list-0005">
<li>B. AWS does guarantee that all SQS messages will be delivered <i>at least</i> once, but the message <i>may be</i>
 delivered more than once (making option A incorrect). This is not 
related to the number of requests to the queue or the applications using
 the queue; therefore, both C and D are incorrect. This leaves B, the 
correct answer.</li>
<li>B, C. This is a common question AWS often asks to ensure that you 
understand that managed services like RDS and DynamoDB are indeed 
completely <i>managed</i>: You cannot access the underlying operating 
system of the service. This leaves EC2 and EMR as the remaining, and 
correct, answers. While EMR does provide you with a lot of functionality
 “out of the box,” it still allows root level access, as do EC2 
instances.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_248"></span>C.
 SQS queues have a visibility timeout that controls how long a message 
in the queue is marked as “invisible” while being processed. This 
accounts for the message “disappearing.” Then, if application processing
 fails—as in option C—the message is remarked as visible and is 
available for processing again. Option A correctly notes this timeout, 
but reducing the timeout would not cause the message to be processed 
correctly. It would just reduce the time that the message is 
“invisible.” Option B is not how queues work; they cannot ask a sender 
to resend a message. Option D is incorrect as well, as the queue is 
operating as intended with regard to visibility of messages and 
timeouts.</li>
<li>D. Snapshots are accessible through the console via username/password and through AWS CLI and APIs via application key.</li>
<li>B. SNS is the Simple Notification Service and functions like a 
mailer, sending out notifications that can be subscribed to by other 
applications.</li>
<li>A. SNS sends out notifications to subscribed listeners, and SWF 
pushes out messages as they arrive. Only SQS holds messages until the 
queue is polled. Redshift is not a messaging service at all but rather a
 data warehousing solution.</li>
<li>B. SNS and SWF operate on a push approach. SQS holds messages until they are pulled out of the queue. S3 is not a message store.</li>
<li>D. Both SWF and SQS deliver a message at least once, but only SWF guarantees that a message will <i>only</i> be delivered a single time.</li>
<li>B. Messages in SWF are tasks; messages in SQS are messages; messages
 in SNS are notifications. S3 is a storage solution, not a messaging 
solution.</li>
<li>C. Messages in SWF are tasks; messages in SQS are messages; messages
 in SNS are notifications. S3 is not a messaging solution at all.</li>
<li>D. Messages in SWF are tasks; messages in SQS are messages; messages
 in SNS are notifications. S3 is not a message store. Since SQS is not 
an option, the answer is D, none of these.</li>
<li>C. SWF is more than a simple queue. It automates workflow, moving a 
task (what SWF calls its messages) from one application component to the
 next in a predetermined order.</li>
<li>B. SWF is not exactly a true acronym. It stands for Simple Workflow Service but is not represented by SWS. Instead, the <i>WF</i> refers to <i>workflow</i>.</li>
<li>A, D. Both EC2 and ECS provide environments on which your custom 
code can run, and both are compute services. S3 is a storage service, 
and Redshift is a data warehousing solution. While Redshift can be 
helpful in analysis of data, it is not suitable for running custom 
scripts.</li>
<li>B. Of the choices available, Amazon Lightsail is the easiest 
solution for getting simple applications running quickly. EC2 and ECS 
are both much more complex. While S3 website hosting is a web hosting 
solution, it does require quite a bit of AWS knowledge (security, 
permissions, etc.).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_249"></span>B,
 D. An EBS snapshot cannot be deleted if it is the root device of a 
registered AMI while that AMI is in use. You’ll need to deregister the 
AMI first (B), and then you can delete the EBS volume and any snapshots 
and stop using the AMI.</li>
<li>A. EBS is considered a subset of EC2 functionality. Therefore, you use the <span class="codeLabel">aws ec2</span> commands; for example, <span class="codeLabel">aws ec2 delete-snapshot</span>.</li>
<li>C. A records are used to point a specific domain or subdomain to an 
IP address. CNAMEs point to a different URL, which in turn can be 
resolved further by DNS. In this case, you’d want to create a CNAME 
record for <span class="codeLabel">applestoapples.com</span> and point that record to <span class="codeLabel">applestoapples.net</span>
 and then let DNS resolve that domain. Using an A record means you’d 
have to lock the record to a specific IP rather than the domain name for
 <span class="codeLabel">applestoapples.net</span>. That’s a problem, 
though, as over time, the domain may be served by different resources 
with different IP addresses, making the A record dated and incorrect.</li>
<li>A. A records are used to point a specific domain or subdomain to an 
IP address. CNAMEs point to URLs or other domain names. In this case, 
since you’re pointing at an ELB, you’d need to use a CNAME, as ELBs 
don’t expose a public IP address.</li>
<li>A. This is a little trickier in terms of picking the <i>best</i> 
answer. It is possible to set a CNAME up and point that at the ALB’s URL
 (B). However, AWS prefers that you use an A record and configure it as 
an alias record, allowing you to direct traffic to the ALB. This is 
different than a standard A record, which can only point at an IP 
address. Option C is incorrect because ALBs don’t expose an IP address, 
and D doesn’t even make sense in this context.</li>
<li>A. AWS supports zone apex records for all domains. A zone apex record is a DNS record at the root, or apex, of a DNS zone. So <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></span>
 is an apex record (sometimes called a naked domain record). Route 53 
absolutely will support zone apex records and allows alias records (of A
 type) at this level as well.</li>
<li>A, D. First, A is false. A zone apex record is a DNS record at the root, or apex, of a DNS zone. So <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></span>
 is an apex record (sometimes called a naked domain record). Route 53 
absolutely will support zone apex records and allows alias records (of A
 type) at this level as well. D is also false; Route 53 supports zone 
apex records for AWS and non-AWS domains and services.</li>
<li>A, D. Route 53 is scalable by design, so there are no steps required
 to make it highly available; this makes D true. Additionally, it 
supports all AWS services, including auto-scaling, so A is true.</li>
<li>D. By default, a single account can manage 50 domains using Route 
53. However, this is a default, and AWS will raise it pretty willingly 
if you call and explain your need for management of additional domains.</li>
<li>D. RDS is a managed system by AWS and does not allow any access to its underlying operating system.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_250"></span>C,
 D. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs but is not 
limited to a single region (so A is false) and is neither VPN nor 
gateway-based (so B is false). This leaves C and D, both of which are 
true: VPCs can be used to share data and can peer across regions.</li>
<li>B. AWS calls a connection between two VPCs via peering across regions an inter-region VPC peering connection.</li>
<li>C. When a VPC peering connection is set up, each VPC will need a route manually added to allow communication to the peered VPC.</li>
<li>D. Most of these statements are false: VPCs in different regions (A)
 and in different accounts (B) can be peered, and if both VPCs are in 
the same account, they can share a security group (C). However, two 
peered VPCs <i>cannot</i> have overlapping CIDR blocks (D).</li>
<li>B. A VPC can have multiple subnets, so a VPC peering relationship is a one-to-one relationship between two VPCs (B).</li>
<li>C. While it is true that transitive peering relationships are not 
allowed (A), you can still peer VPCs B and C to allow traffic to flow 
between the two VPCs.</li>
<li>B, C. VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks cannot be removed as is (B),
 and therefore the overlap must be removed (C). Changing either VPC to 
IPv6 <i>might</i> be a working solution (D) but is not a requirement.</li>
<li>A. Regardless of subnet, NACL, or any other networking 
consideration, you can only create one VPC connection between two VPCs 
at a time.</li>
<li>B. A VPC can be a part of an unlimited number of VPC connections, as
 long as those connections are all with different VPCs and you stay 
within AWS’s overall account limits. Only one peering connection between
 two specific VPCs is possible; for example, only one connection can 
exist between VPC A and VPC B. But VPC A can have as many peering 
connections–each with a different VPC–as there are VPCs with which you 
can connect.</li>
<li>C. Transitive VPC relationships are not allowed in AWS. Most of these answers are complete gibberish!</li>
<li>B, D. First, AWS does not support IPv6 inter-region communication. 
This means that for IPv6 communication to work, the two VPCs must be in 
the same region (D). Then, you must ensure that both VPCs have IPv6 
addresses and that routing is set up to use those addresses (B).</li>
<li>A, C. EC2-Classic was a flat network that offered very little in the
 way of multiple options. With VPCs, you can assign multiple IP 
addresses as well as multiple network interfaces (A and C).</li>
<li>A, D. Default VPCs come with both an internet gateway and public 
subnets. If you think through this, these two go hand in hand: A public 
subnet would need an internet gateway to function as public.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_251"></span>A,
 D. The default VPC has public subnets within it. Further, it provides a
 default routing table that provides access to and from these instances 
and the public Internet (A). Additionally, an internet gateway is added 
to the VPC by default (D).</li>
<li>C. Non-default subnets and their instances are not public by 
default. Therefore, they are assigned a private IPv4 address (C) rather 
than a public one.</li>
<li>B, C. Non-default subnets are private by default. Therefore, you 
need an internet gateway on the containing VPC (C) as well as giving the
 instance a public IP address (B). While a NAT instance <i>might</i> 
work (D), it would need to be in a different, public subnet rather than 
in the same subnet as the instance trying to reach the Internet.</li>
<li>D. SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language, allows you to 
provide federated single sign-on access to the AWS management console.</li>
<li>C. Remember that AWS provides a principle of least privilege and 
always wants to limit access to only what a user (or service) needs. 
Therefore, new IAM users do not have any access to AWS services and must
 be granted access to any service explicitly.</li>
<li>B. IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.</li>
<li>A, C. IAM users logging into the AWS console will need a username, 
password, and the sign-in URL. If the user needs access to AWS APIs or 
the SDK, then they will need their access key ID and secret access key. 
Keep in mind that these credential pairs are <i>not</i> interchangeable.</li>
<li>A. Of these groups, only the Administrator group provides write 
access to all AWS services. The Power User group provides access to 
developer-related services, but not <i>all</i> services (like IAM). The Support User group is for creating and viewing support cases.</li>
<li>D. New users will need a customized sign-in link for accessing the 
console (D). They will then use this link to sign in using their 
username and password.</li>
<li>B. There are two key parts to this question: the mobile client that 
must have an endpoint to which it can send data and the receiver for a 
huge amount of data, as the question indicates millions of users. Mobile
 SDK is a bit of a giveaway for the mobile component. This also 
helpfully narrows the answer choices down to A and B. Of the two 
options, Kinesis and EC2, only Kinesis is built to handle a massive data
 stream. While you could theoretically scale up enough EC2 instances to 
serve an API for that volume of requests, it really makes no sense. 
Kinesis is built for incoming data streams, so is the better option.</li>
<li>B. A new AWS account requires the company email (or account owner 
email) for the root account holder, or a generic email for the company 
as a whole.</li>
<li>A, D. Both the Administrators and the Power Users default policies 
provide read and write access to most AWS services. Power Users limits 
access to IAM, but that would not affect access to S3 or EC2.</li>
<li>C. A policy is AWS’s document type for describing a set of permissions.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_252"></span>B.
 ECS is the Elastic Container Service, AWS’s service for running 
applications in containers and managing the starting, stopping, and 
scaling of those containers.</li>
<li>C, D. Containers allow you to reduce startup times, as they are 
launched into already-running instances in most cases (C). This also 
touches on AWS’s facility to manage and provision the instances on which
 the containers run (D), another advantage. While you can scale 
applications in containers (A), you can just as easily scale 
applications on EC2 instances. Finally, option B is simply false.</li>
<li>A. The first thing here is to know these various acronyms. ECR is 
the Elastic Container Registry, ECS is the Elastic Container Service, 
EC2 is Elastic Compute Cloud, EMR is Elastic MapReduce, and of course S3
 is Simple Storage Service. Given that, only A has all the needed 
components: the registry (ECR), the management service (ECS), and 
instances on which to run containers (EC2). Note that even though you 
might not use EC2 explicitly for your containers, it or Fargate will be 
required to manage instances at some level, even if only by AWS for you.</li>
<li>C. You’ll need to know these various acronyms. ECR is the Elastic 
Container Registry, ECS is the Elastic Container Service, EMR is Elastic
 MapReduce, and S3 is Simple Storage Service. ECC isn’t an AWS acronym, 
so it is immediately out. Of those left, ECR, the Elastic Container 
Registry, is most closely associated with ECS.</li>
<li>B, C. Containers allow you to co-locate applications on instances 
and more effectively use your available instances without a lot of 
overhead, so B is true. C is in a similar vein: Containers reduce the 
management overhead of instances. A is not true, as containers don’t 
significantly change your cost structure, and D is false, as containers 
and instances can both scale up and down to meet demand.</li>
<li>A, D. Containers are applications (D) that scale based on 
application load (A). Lambda, in contrast, runs isolated pieces of code 
and not entire application tiers. Additionally, Lambda launches based on
 events rather than load. (Note that you could actually set up load 
monitors in CloudWatch and trigger Lambda based on load, although that 
is not automatic as it is in containers.)</li>
