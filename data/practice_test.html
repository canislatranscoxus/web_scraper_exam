<p>You are responsible for a large AWS environment, and specifically, 
several subnets within a custom VPC. The VPC contains both public and 
private subnets. There are approximately 300 EC2 instances within one of
 the private subnets that uses a NAT device to reach the Internet. Each 
evening at 11 p.m., the instances push the day’s date to an external 
data store outside of AWS, available via an API that is Internet 
accessible. However, you are seeing that not all of the data is getting 
out each evening, and several of the instances show failed transmissions
 to the external API. Assuming the API itself is not an issue, what 
should you consider when attempting to fix this issue? (Choose two.)</p>
<ol id="cpra-list-0007" type="a">
<li>The instances are saturating the VPC’s internet gateway. Consider attaching an additional internet gateway to the VPC.</li>

too small to handle the traffic. Reprovision the NAT instance on a 
larger instance size with more CPU.</li>
<li>Set up an SQS queue with all the desired transmissions as entries in
 the queue. Have the EC2 instances poll the queue and transmit data 
until the queue is completely empty. Add a Lambda job to detect failed 
transmissions and re-add the failed operation to the SQS queue.</li>
<li>The instances cannot support the required throughput. Re-provision 
the instances to use EBS volumes with provisioned IOPS as the volume 
type.</li>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_175"></span>You
 have recently taken on architecture at a large genomics nonprofit. 
Currently, the organization imports hundreds of terabytes (TB) daily and
 then needs to run complex queries against that data. The queries can 
take several hours, and at times even days, to complete. They write 
their state to S3 frequently so the queries can recover from failure 
without restarting. The organization wants to minimize costs associated 
with this processing. What technologies and recommendations might you 
suggest? (Choose two.)</p>
<ol id="cpra-list-0041" type="a">
<li>Create an SQS instance and queue up references to all the data that 
needs to be queried as it comes in. Ensure that the queue is readable 
via EC2 instances.</li>
<li>Create a new IAM role that allows EC2 instances to write data to S3 stores.</li>
<li>Set up a placement group with EC2 instances that can read from the SQS queue and run the queries against referenced data.</li>
<li>Set up EC2 spot instances that can read from the SQS queue and S3 and run the queries on those instances.</li>
</ol></div>

<li class="essay">
<div class="question">
<p>You have an application that consists of worker nodes that are 
on-demand instances and processing nodes that are a mixture of on-demand
 instances and spot instances. Your application collects information and
 does initial processing as it comes in from users using the worker 
nodes. Then, the processing nodes perform analytics each evening. Your 
goal is to use spot instances for most of this processing and only 
overflow to the on-demand instances in times of high load. However, the 
spot instances have been terminating more often lately, causing more 
usage of the on-demand instances. What might you do to increase the 
usage of the spot instances?</p>
<ol id="cpra-list-0042" type="a">
<li>Convert the on-demand processing instances to spot instances so more spot instances will be available.</li>
<li>Convert the worker node instances to spot instances so more spot instances will be available.</li>
<li>Lower the bid price on the spot instances to ensure only lower-priced instances are used.</li>
<li>Raise the bid price on the spot instances so that they will run longer before termination occurs.</li>

<p>AWS supports two types of virtualization: paravirtual and hardware 
virtual machines. Why might you choose one type of virtualization over 
the other?</p>
<ol id="cpra-list-0047" type="a">
<li>Paravirtualization allows the use of hardware extensions like 
enhanced networking and GPU processing, but hardware virtualization does
 not.</li>

 the same way; neither is a better performance choice than the other.</li>

 have set up three read replicas of your primary database instance. You 
have noticed that reads of the replicas do not always return consistent 
results, especially after large writes to the primary database instance.
 What might the problem be?</p>
<ol id="cpra-list-0053" type="a">
<li>This is normal; replication from a primary instance to read replicas always takes between 30 and 60 seconds.</li>
<li>This is normal; replication from a primary instance to read replicas
 is asynchronous and, although sometimes nearly instant, may also at 
times take longer to complete.</li>
