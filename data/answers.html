<ol id="capp-list-0001">
<li>B. This is a common question on AWS exams, and relates to your 
understanding of the various S3 classes. S3 and S3-IA have the same 
durability, but the availability of S3 is one 9 greater than S3-IA. S3 
has 99.99 availability, while S3-IA has 99.9 availability. Glacier has 
much greater first-byte latency than S3, so both C and D are false.</li>
<li>B. Anytime the primary consideration is storage with a local data 
presence—where data must be stored or seen to be stored locally—a 
storage gateway gives you the best option. This reduces the choices to B
 and D. B will store the files in S3 and provide local cached copies, 
while D will store the files locally and push them to S3 as a backup. 
Since management is concerned about storage in the cloud of primary 
files, B is the best choice; local files are the primary source of data,
 while still allowing the company to experiment with cloud storage 
without “risking” its data being stored primarily in the cloud.</li>
<li>B. Many of these answers are nonsensical in terms of what AWS 
allows. The limits on size related to S3 are for objects; an individual 
object can be as large as 5 TB. Both A and C, then, are not useful (or 
possible). D proposes to increase the maximum object size to 50 GB, but 
the maximum object size is already 5 TB. Option B is correct; AWS 
recommends using Multipart Upload for all objects larger than 100 MB.</li>
<li>C, D. PUTs of new objects have a read after write consistency. DELETEs and overwrite PUTs have eventual consistency across S3.</li>
<li>C. First, note that “on standard class S3” is a red herring, and 
irrelevant to the question. Second, objects on S3 can be 0 bytes. This 
is equivalent to using touch on a file and then uploading that 0-byte 
file to S3.</li>
<li>A. This is a matter of carefully looking at each URL. Bucket 
names—when not used as a website—always come after the fully qualified 
domain name (FQDN); in other words, after the forward slash. That 
eliminates C. Additionally, the region always comes earlier in the FQDN 
than amazonaws.com, eliminating D. This leaves A and B. Of the two, A 
correctly has the complete region, us-east-2.</li>
<li>C. This is another question that is tricky unless you work through 
each part of the URL, piece by piece. The first clue is that this is a 
website hosted on S3, as opposed to directly accessing an S3 bucket. 
Where website hosting is concerned, the bucket name is <i>part of</i> the FQDN; where direct bucket access is concerned, the bucket name comes <i>after</i>
 the FQDN. This is an essential distinction. This means that A and B are
 invalid. Then, you need to recall that the s3-website portion of the 
FQDN is always connected to the region; in other words, it is not a 
subdomain. The only option where this is the case is C.</li>
<li>A. This is another case of rote memorization. S3 and S3-IA have the 
same durability; however, the availability of S3 is higher (99.99 vs. 
the 99.9 of S3-IA). Both Glacier and S3-IA have the same durability of 
standard S3, so both C and D are false.</li>
<li>B. This is an important distinction when understanding S3 classes. 
Standard S3, S3-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA all are equally durable, although
 in One Zone-IA, data will be lost if <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_183"></span>the
 availability zone is destroyed. Each class has different availability, 
though: S3 is 99.99, S3-IA is 99.9, and S3 One Zone-IA is 99.5. 
Therefore, it is false that all have the same availability (B).</li>
<li>A, C. The wording of this question is critical. S3 buckets are 
created within a region, but the AWS console and your account will show 
you <i>all</i> S3 buckets at all times. While a bucket is created in a 
specific region, names of buckets are also global. IAM permissions are 
also global and affect all regions. RDS and EC2 instances are region 
specific, and only appear in the regions in which they were created in 
the AWS console.</li>
<li>A, D. EBS volumes are block-based storage, meaning that A is correct
 and B is incorrect. That leaves C and D. The default EBS volume is SSD,
 so C is false. However, EBS volumes can be in a variety of types, 
including magnetic and SSD options, so D is true.</li>
<li>D. AMIs are not cross-region, regardless of account or security 
group. This makes B and C invalid. A is a valid choice but will not 
preserve any of the permissions or roles that allow the instance to 
connect to S3. Therefore, D is the correct option: manual configuration 
of the AMI <i>after</i> it has been copied is required for correct operation.</li>
<li>D. This is a bit of a trick question if you’re not careful. While S3
 allows for 0-byte objects, and charges as such, S3-IA charges all 
objects as if they are <i>at least</i> 128 KB in size. So while you can 
store a smaller object in S3-IA, it will be considered 128 KB for 
pricing and charging purposes.</li>
<li>A, D. A Multi-AZ setup is the easiest solution, and the most common.
 Turning on read replicas (option B) is not a guarantee, as read 
replicas are not automatically installed in different AZs or regions. 
However, with option D, a cross-region replica configuration will ensure
 multiple regions are used. A storage gateway (option C) is backed by 
S3, not RDS.</li>
<li>A, D. Launch configurations are concerned primarily with creating 
new instances while staying abstract from the details of what is on 
those instances. So the AMI and IAM role for an instance is a general 
configuration, applies to all created instances, and is correct (A and 
D). The polling time for latency isn’t connected to launching new 
instances (although it might be a trigger configured elsewhere). Each 
instance is associated with a different EBS volume, so selecting an EBS 
volume for multiple instances doesn’t actually make sense.</li>
<li>D. Launch configurations are where details are specified for 
creating (launching) new instances (option D). Security groups have to 
do more with what traffic is allowed into and out of the launched 
instances. The remaining two options—A and C—don’t make sense in this 
context.</li>
<li>D. By default, EBS root volumes are terminated when the associated 
instance is terminated. However, this is only the default value; 
therefore A is not correct. Option B is not directly addressing the 
question; the EBS volume would still be deleted even if you take a 
snapshot. Option C is not relevant, but option D is: You can use the AWS
 CLI (or the console) to set the root volume to persist after instance 
termination.</li>
<li>B. EBS volumes are backed up to S3 incrementally.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_184"></span>B. EBS volumes can only attach to a single instance at one time. The other options are all simply to distract.</li>
<li>A, B. All instances and most services in AWS provide tagging for 
metadata. Certificates are related to SSL and help define the identity 
of a site or transmission, policies are related to permissions and 
roles, and labels are not (currently) an AWS construct.</li>
<li>A, B. Valid concerns in this list include placing storage close to 
your users, to reduce network latency, and distance from your operations
 center. This latter is a little less obvious but is centered around 
disaster recovery scenarios: If a disaster destroyed your operations 
center, you would not want your storage on AWS to be geographically in 
the same area.</li>
<li>B. Every EC2 instance provides the option to specify an availability
 zone. While you don’t have to specify something other than the default,
 instances are always provisioned in a specific availability zone, which
 is user configurable.</li>
<li>C. Spread placement groups—which are relatively new to AWS—can be 
placed across multiple availability zones. Cluster placement groups 
cannot, and <i>placement groups</i> generally refers to cluster placement groups. <i>Cross-region placement groups</i> is a made-up term.</li>
<li>C. A customer gateway is the anchor on the customer side of an 
Amazon VPN connection. A storage gateway is for caching or storing data 
and connecting to S3. A virtual private gateway is an important part of a
 VPN connection but exists on the AWS side of the connection. A virtual 
private network is actually what VPN stands for.</li>
<li>B. VPN connections between an on-premises site and AWS consist of a 
customer gateway on the customer side and a virtual private gateway on 
the AWS side.</li>
<li>B. A typical VPN connection uses two different tunnels for 
redundancy. Both tunnels move between the customer gateway and the 
virtual private gateway.</li>
<li>D. Traffic begins at the on-premises site, which means starting at a
 customer gateway. Traffic then flows through the Internet and to the 
virtual private gateway at AWS. Then, from the gateway, traffic can flow
 into an Amazon VPC.</li>
<li>A, C. Traffic across the Internet can only flow between public IP 
addresses in most cases. For a VPN connection, you will need a customer 
gateway with a public IP address as well as a virtual private gateway 
with a public IP address, both of which you may be responsible for 
configuring. A VPC does not have an IP address of its own (making option
 B incorrect), and VPN tunnels do not either (option D).</li>
<li>A. A storage gateway is the correct answer, as it is used for 
caching or storing data and connecting to S3. A customer gateway is the 
anchor on the customer side of an Amazon VPN connection. A virtual 
private gateway is used for connecting into AWS via a VPN, and a virtual
 private network is actually what VPN stands for.</li>
<li>A, B. Both file and volume gateways offer solutions for connecting 
to cloud-based storage. A cached gateway isn’t an AWS option, and a 
virtual private gateway is used in creating VPN connections.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_185"></span>A.
 Each of the options is a valid configuration for a storage gateway. Of 
the options, file gateway provides an NFS-style protocol for 
transferring data to and from the gateway and therefore is the best 
option.</li>
<li>D. This is relatively easy because the word <i>tape</i> actually 
appears in both the question and the answer. A tape gateway backs up 
data in Amazon Glacier while providing a virtual tape infrastructure 
that many existing tape backup systems can utilize.</li>
<li>C. A stored volume gateway stores data at the on-premises data store
 and backs up to S3 asynchronously to support disaster recovery. Most 
important, though, is that by storing data locally, network latency is 
minimal. Of the available options, only a stored volume gateway provides
 local data with this speed of access across an entire dataset.</li>
<li>C. Anytime very large data needs to be moved into AWS, consider 
Snowball. Snowball is a physical device that allows for data to be 
physically sent to AWS rather than transferred over a network. It is the
 only solution that will not potentially cause disruptive network 
outages or slowdowns.</li>
<li>A, C. A cached volume gateway stores the most commonly accessed data
 locally (option D) while keeping the entire dataset in S3. This has the
 effect of reducing the cost of storage on-site, because you need less 
(option B). Since both of these are true, you need to select the other 
two options as reasons to <i>not</i> use a cached volumes gateway: A and C.</li>
<li>A. Be careful here. While it might seem at a glance that a tape 
gateway is best, most backup solutions do not employ tape backups. They 
use NFS mounts and file-based backups, which is exactly what a file 
gateway is best used for.</li>
<li>B. A cached volume gateway is ideal when a <i>portion</i> of a 
dataset is at issue. The most used data will be cached, and therefore 
stored in the local cache on premises. If the entire dataset is needed, 
then a stored volume gateway is a better choice.</li>
<li>C. If the entire dataset is needed, then a stored volume gateway is a
 better choice than a cached volume gateway. The stored volume stores 
the entire dataset on premises and therefore is very fast for all data 
access.</li>
<li>D. A tape gateway is ideal for replacing off-site tape directories. 
The gateway is a virtual tape directory and avoids the costs of 
transporting actual tapes to an expensive off-site location.</li>
<li>D. This should be automatic: Glacier is the Amazon offering for long-term “on ice” storage.</li>
<li>B, D. Launch configurations are specific to a region, as are EC2 
instances. While S3 buckets are created in a region, their names are 
global. IAM users also exist across all of your account.</li>
<li>A. HTTP 200 is the general return for success, and this is the case for S3 uploads as well.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_186"></span>D. This is easy to miss. All S3 storage classes (S3 standard, S3-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA) share the same durability of 11 9s.</li>
<li>D. This is easy to miss. All S3 storage classes (S3 standard, S3-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA) share the same durability of 11 9s.</li>
<li>D. All S3 storage classes (S3 standard, S3-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA) share the same durability of 11 9s.</li>
<li>A. While all S3 storage classes share the same durability, they have
 varying availability. S3-IA has 99.9%, while S3 One Zone-IA is less 
(99.5%), and S3 standard is higher (99.99%).</li>
<li>B. While all S3 storage classes share the same durability, they have
 varying availability. S3-IA has 99.9%, while S3 One Zone-IA is less 
(99.5%), and S3 standard is higher (99.99%).</li>
<li>C. While all S3 storage classes share the same durability, S3 standard has the highest availability, at 99.99%.</li>
<li>D. All of the S3 storage classes support both SSL for data in transit and encryption for data at rest.</li>
<li>D. All of the S3 storage classes support both SSL for data in transit and encryption for data at rest.</li>
<li>D. All S3 storage classes have buckets that can be created in a 
specific region. The objects in the buckets are then stored in 
availability zones within that region, depending upon the storage class.</li>
<li>D. While S3 does use availability zones to store objects in buckets,
 you do not choose the availability zone yourself. Even S3 One Zone-IA 
does not allow you to specify the AZ for&nbsp;use.</li>
<li>A. S3 storage is key based. Keys can be a string and the value is the uploaded object.</li>
<li>C, D. S3 does not provide SSH or SFTP access, nor standard FTP 
access. You can access your data through the AWS console and through a 
REST interface via HTTP.</li>
<li>B, C. S3 is built to automatically scale in times of heavy 
application usage. There is no requirement to enable Auto Scaling (A); 
rather, this happens automatically (so B is correct). Further, S3 tends 
to scale evenly across the AWS network (C). Option D is the opposite of 
what AWS intends.</li>
<li>B. When evaluating S3 storage, all storage classes have the same 
durability. For cost, though, S3 One Zone-IA is the clear winner. Only 
Glacier is potentially less expensive but does not provide the same 
quick file access that S3 One Zone-IA does.</li>
<li>D. This is nearly a trick question. S3 in general is built for 
scalability, and the different storage classes are not substantially 
different in terms of how they can scale. However, without knowing how 
quickly data retrieval must be, and the priorities of the data, it is 
impossible to choose between S3 standard and S3-IA, and in some cases, 
even Glacier.</li>
<li>C. By default, all AWS accounts can create up to 100 buckets. 
However, this limit can easily be raised by AWS if you request an 
upgrade.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_187"></span>B.
 S3 uploads are, by default, done via a single operation, usually via a 
single PUT operation. AWS suggests that you can upload objects up to 100
 MB before changing to Multipart Upload.</li>
<li>B. Using the Multipart Upload is almost entirely a function of the 
size of the files being uploaded. AWS recommends using it for any files 
greater than 100 MB, and 10 GB is certainly large enough to benefit from
 Multipart Uploads.</li>
<li>A, C. Multipart Upload is, as should be the easiest answer, ideal 
for large objects on stable networks (A). But it also helps handle 
less-reliable networks as smaller parts can fail while others get 
through, reducing the overall failure rate (C). There is no cost 
associated with data ingress (B), and D doesn’t make much sense at all!</li>
<li>A, C. Presigned URLs are created to allow users without AWS 
credentials to access specific resources (option C). And it’s the 
creator of the URL (option A) that assigns these permissions, rather 
than the user (option B). Finally, these credentials are associated with
 the URL but are not encrypted into the URL itself.</li>
<li>D. Presigned URLs are not tied to specific AWS services. They are 
simply URLs that can point at anything a normal URL can point at, except
 that the creator can associate permissions and a timeout with the URL.</li>
<li>D. A presigned URL is always configured at creation for a valid Time
 to Live (often referred to as TTL). This time can be very short, or 
quite long.</li>
<li>B, D. Overwrite PUTs and DELETEs have eventual consistency. PUTs of new objects have write and then read consistency.</li>
<li>D. These are all consistent with S3 behavior. Option A could occur 
as the new object is being propagated to additional S3 buckets. B and C 
could occur as a result of eventual consistency, where a DELETE 
operation does not immediately appear.</li>
<li>C. All regions have eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs.</li>
<li>A, D. All S3 storage classes are object-based, while EBS and EFS are block-based.</li>
<li>B. EBS stands for Elastic Block Storage.</li>
<li>B. New objects uploaded via PUT are subject to read after write consistency. Overwrite PUTs use the eventual consistency model.</li>
<li>C. This is important because it reflects a recent change by AWS. 
Until 2018, there was a hard limit on S3 of 100 PUTs per second, but 
that limit has now been raised to 3500 PUTs per second.</li>
<li>B. S3 buckets have names based upon the S3 identifier (s3), the region (us-west-1 in this case), and the <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://amazonaws.com/">amazonaws.com</a></span> domain. Then, the bucket name appears <i>after</i> the domain. That results in B, <span class="codeLabel"><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prototypeBucket32">https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prototypeBucket32</a></span>. Option A has an incorrect region, and both C and D have the bucket name in the domain, which is incorrect.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_188"></span>A. S3 buckets have names based upon the S3 identifier (s3), the region (us-east-1 in this case), and the <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://amazonaws.com/">amazonaws.com</a></span> domain. Then, the bucket name appears <i>after</i> the domain. That results in a URL like <span class="codeLabel"><a href="https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prototypeBucket32">https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prototypeBucket32</a></span>. However, buckets in US East are a special case and should use the special, unique endpoint <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/"><i>s3.amazonaws.com</i></a> (option A).</li>
<li>B, C. Option A is not the correct format; s3 should be separated 
from the region with a dash (-). Option B is valid, and option C is the 
correct unique URL for US East (N. Virginia). Option D is the right 
format, but jp-west-2 is not an AWS region.</li>
<li>A, D. S3 supports two styles of bucket URLs: virtual-hosted-style 
and path-style URLs. Virtual-hosted-style URLs are of the form <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://bucket.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com/">http://bucket.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com</a></span>, and path-style URLs are the traditional URLs you’ve seen: <span class="codeLabel"><a href="https://s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name">https://s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name</a></span>.</li>
<li>B, D. Option A is not a valid URL for S3. Option B is, using the 
path-style URLs that are most common for S3 buckets. Option C uses a 
nonexistent region (mx-central-1). Option D is valid and uses the 
virtual-hosted-style URL format.</li>
<li>D. AWS storage gateway is a virtual appliance that allows 
on-premises sites to interact with S3 while still caching (in certain 
configurations) data locally.</li>
<li>B. AWS storage gateway is a virtual appliance and is not available as a hardware appliance.</li>
<li>B, D. While S3 buckets are created in a specific region (A), the 
names of buckets are global and must exist in a global namespace (so B 
is untrue). Buckets are object-based (so C is true), and while a single 
object is limited at 5 TB, the buckets are unlimited in total storage 
capacity (so D is false).</li>
<li>A, D. S3 supports read after write consistency for PUTs of new objects and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs.</li>
<li>C, D. S3 objects have a key, a value, and a version ID, so the correct answers are C and D.</li>
<li>C. MFA Delete is the absolute best means of ensuring that objects 
are not accidentally deleted. MFA—Multi-Factor Authentication—ensures 
that any object deletion requires multiple forms of authentication.</li>
<li>B. All Amazon-specific request headers begin with x-amz. This is 
important to remember as it will help eliminate lots of incorrect 
answers. This leaves only x-amz-mfa.</li>
<li>B, C. MFA Delete applies to deleting objects, not buckets (so option
 A is incorrect). It affects changing the versioning state of a bucket 
or permanently deleting any object (or a version of that object); this 
makes B and C correct. Deleting an object’s metadata while leaving the 
object intact does not require MFA Delete.</li>
<li>A. This answer simply has to be memorized. MFA Delete authentication
 codes are pulled from hardware or virtual MFA devices, like Google 
Authenticator on an iPhone.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_189"></span>D.
 This is tricky and somewhat un-intuitive. Only the root account can 
enable MFA Delete. Even the console user that created the bucket—if it 
isn’t the root user—cannot enable MFA Delete on a bucket.</li>
<li>B. The bucket owner, root account, and all authorized IAM users of a bucket are allowed to enable versioning.</li>
<li>A, B. Each object in S3 has a name, value (data), version ID, and 
metadata. The version history of an object won’t exist unless versioning
 is turned on, so it’s not always a valid answer.</li>
<li>B. All metadata in AWS is currently entered using tags, name-value pairs available through the console.</li>
<li>D. All versions of an object are stored, regardless of how that object is deleted.</li>
<li>D. Once enabled, it is not possible to disable or turn off 
versioning on an S3 bucket. While you can suspend versioning, this 
doesn’t actually turn versioning off, and old versions are preserved.</li>
<li>B, C. CloudFront is intended to cache and deliver static files from 
your origin servers to users or clients. Dynamic content is also 
servable through CloudFront from EC2 or other web servers. Object-based 
storage doesn’t make sense in this context, as CloudFront is a 
distribution mechanism, not a storage facility.</li>
<li>D. CloudFront serves content from origin servers, usually static 
files and dynamic responses. These origin servers are often S3 buckets 
for static content and EC2 instances for dynamic content.</li>
<li>A, D. CloudFront serves content from origin servers, usually static 
files and dynamic responses. These origin servers are often S3 buckets 
for static content and EC2 instances for dynamic content (options A and 
D).</li>
<li>B, D. CloudFront serves content from origin servers, usually static 
files and dynamic responses. These origin servers are often S3 buckets 
for static content and EC2 instances for dynamic content (meaning option
 C is valid). Containers can also be used in place of EC2 instances, 
making option A valid as well. This leaves B and D as invalid origin 
servers.</li>
<li>B. CloudFront stores content as cached content on edge locations across the world.</li>
<li>C, D. CloudFront is able to distribute content from an ELB, rather 
than directly interfacing with S3, and can do the same with a Route 53 
recordset. These allow the content to come from multiple instances. This
 means that options C and D are invalid origin servers and therefore the
 correct answers.</li>
<li>D. A CloudFront distribution is a collection of edge locations across the world.</li>
<li>B. First, you can eliminate any answer where fewer availability 
zones are indicated than regions, because each region has multiple 
availability zones (A and D). This leaves B and C. There are more edge 
locations than availability zones, which means that B is correct.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_190"></span>A,
 B. This question is simple if you remember that, from most to least, 
the ordering goes edge locations (most) to availability zones to regions
 (least). Knowing that, options A and B are correct.</li>
<li>B, D. Availability zones are not content storage devices; they are 
virtual data centers. Edge locations are used by CloudFront 
distributions to store cached content (so correct). Route 53 is the 
Amazon DNS service. EC2 instances can serve content from processes (so 
also correct).</li>
<li>A, D. While edge locations are typically read from by clients, they 
are also writeable. You can store objects on edge locations as well as 
read from them.</li>
<li>A, C. The obvious answer here is an S3 bucket. EC2 locations are 
compute, not storage, and availability zones are virtual data centers. 
This leaves edge locations, which allow objects to be written directly 
to them.</li>
<li>A. TTL is Time to Live, the amount of time an object is cached on a CloudFront edge location.</li>
<li>B, D. You must perform <i>both</i> steps B and D, and you must perform B <i>before</i> D or the banner ad could get re-cached. Also note that expiring a cached object manually incurs a cost.</li>
<li>B. The default TTL for edge locations is 24 hours.</li>
<li>B. All new S3 buckets are private by default.</li>
<li>B, C. The correct answers are ACLs—access control lists—and bucket 
policies (B and C). NACLs are network access lists, used for securing 
VPCs and individual instances, and JSON is used for writing policies.</li>
<li>C. S3 bucket policies are written in JSON, the JavaScript Object 
Notation. XML is not used much in AWS, and YAML is often used for 
CloudFormation. AML is made up!</li>
<li>A. All data is backed up to S3 asynchronously when a stored volume 
is used. This ensures that no lag is incurred by clients that interact 
with the stored volumes on-site.</li>
<li>A. This is a little harder unless you’ve seen the term <i>virtual tape library (VTL)</i>
 before. A tape volume is in fact a virtual tape library. Fortunately, 
even if you’ve never heard of a VTL, you can reason it out based on the 
other incorrect options: A VPC is a virtual private cloud, a VPN is a 
virtual private network, and NetBackup is an application, not a tape 
volume.</li>
<li>A. This is an easy one: Snowball is the AWS solution for transferring large datasets.</li>
<li>D. Snowball actually does not support any code. You just transfer 
your data to the device and send it to Amazon. Additionally, 
CloudFormation is not a language; you use YAML (for example) to write 
CloudFormation templates.</li>
<li>A. AWS Direct Connect is a dedicated high-speed connection between 
your on-premises network and AWS. Because of this, a direct connect is 
almost always a better choice than shipping out a Snowball, loading data
 to it, and then shipping it back.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_191"></span>A.
 All Snowball devices provide data transfer, but Snowball Edge offers 
data processing (“at the edge”) before that data is returned to AWS 
(option A).</li>
<li>C. Snowball can serve as both an import and export device, both to and from S3.</li>
<li>C. Decoupling separates application layers, primarily in an attempt 
to reduce failures across an entire application. Limiting application 
interdependence helps limit failures “crossing” application layers.</li>
<li>D. Redshift is an OLAP (online analytics processing) service suitable for data warehousing.</li>
<li>B. While using separate VPCs and subnets offers some degree of 
redundancy, there’s nothing in the answers that suggests that additional
 VPCs or subnets are separated from the original. This makes B, 
launching instances in separate regions, the best choice. (Option D 
doesn’t make much sense.)</li>
<li>A. CloudFront is the only option here that uses edge locations. Note
 that Snowball offers Snowball Edge, but that is not to be confused with
 an edge location.</li>
<li>C. This should be pretty basic: Running an application in two 
availability zones is going to provide fault tolerance, because if one 
AZ fails, the application will keep running.</li>
<li>B, D. While all of the answers are storage-based services, A and C 
are databases, and relational ones at that. Options B and D, S3 and EBS,
 offer file storage.</li>
<li>B, C. This is a little tricky. S3 is an obvious choice. Redshift is 
suited for analysis data, so probably not large objects. EC2 is compute,
 which leaves Oracle. It is possible—without any better answers—to use 
Oracle (via RDS or installed on EC2) to store large objects in a 
BLOB-type field.</li>
<li>B. S3 Transfer Acceleration speeds up transfers to S3, although it 
does add cost to your application. Snowball is for data migration (A). 
AWS manages the network, so C is not an option, and D doesn’t make sense
 in this context.</li>
<li>B. It’s the users who are the farthest from your buckets that 
benefit most. This is because these users are incurring the longest 
delays in uploading and are therefore affected the most by the benefits.</li>
<li>A, C. The key here is to understand which problems <i>will</i> be solved by Transfer Acceleration versus which ones <i>might</i>
 be solved. With Transfer Acceleration, you’re generally looking at 
problems related to large datasets being transferred over significant 
distances. In this case, that’s A and C. While performance (B) and 
latency (D) might be connected to transfer speeds, there’s no guarantee 
of that, so those are both incorrect answers.</li>
<li>A, C. This should be easy. You can host websites on EC2 easily, and S3 also offers static website hosting.</li>
<li>C. This is a case of memorization. While B is a valid S3 bucket URL,
 it is not the URL for website hosting. D is in the incorrect region, 
and also has a dot instead of a dash between s3-website and the region 
name. This leaves A and C. C is correct, as A incorrectly breaks up the 
s3-website and region portions of the domain name, using a dot instead 
of a dash between s3-website and the region name.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_192"></span>D.
 First, ensure that the domain name is correct. Option A incorrectly 
separates s3-website from the region, and C has the wrong region. B does
 not have the bucket name in the URL, which it should for website 
hosting. This leaves D, the correct answer.</li>
<li>A. First, eliminate option D; the domain is incorrect, adding a 
separator between s3-website and the region. Then, eliminate option C, 
as it adds a <span class="codeLabel">public_html</span> to the portion 
of the URL after the domain, which is also incorrect. This leaves A and 
B. Here, you need to realize that the portion of a URL after the domain 
is case sensitive and compare the two directories to the question. A is 
correct, using the correct capitalization of phoneboothPhotos.</li>
<li>A, D. To minimize compute resources, you should avoid EC2 and 
Lambda. Enabling static website hosting on an S3 bucket is a better 
option. To use a custom domain, you’d need to also use Route 53 to 
direct traffic from your custom domain to the S3 bucket.</li>
<li>C, D. If the website was static content, S3 bucket hosting would be 
ideal. However, to support dynamic content, you will need some sort of 
compute service: EC2 or Lambda. To minimize costs and avoid incurring 
additional costs when requests aren’t occurring, Lambda allows 
as-you-need-it serverless responses to requests. Route 53 allows you to 
direct traffic aimed at your custom domain to Lambda.</li>
<li>A, C. EC2 is, by definition, a server-driven option. Both S3—through
 static website hosting—and Lambda offer serverless options for serving 
content. Route 53 provides DNS but is not on its own capable of serving 
website content.</li>
<li>B, C. While S3 can serve static content, it has no capability for 
processing code or otherwise providing dynamic content. EC2 provides for
 dynamic content through server-driven compute, and Lambda provides 
dynamic content through serverless compute.</li>
<li>A, C. Elastic Beanstalk is focused on code deployment. It provides 
that, and in the process, load balancing, Auto Scaling, health 
monitoring, and capacity provisioning (C).</li>
<li>B, D. Elastic Beanstalk is focused on code deployment (A). It 
provides that, and in the process, load balancing, Auto Scaling, health 
monitoring (C), and capacity provisioning. It does not provide security 
or log inspection.</li>
<li>A, D. This is a little far off the beaten AWS path, but you should 
know which languages and technologies are commonly used and cited by AWS
 and which are not. In general, Docker and containers are always 
supported; and Node.js, JavaScript, Java, PHP, and Perl are commonly 
supported. C++ and Scala are not in that list.</li>
<li>D. The best way to work this question is to immediately recognize 
the common languages: Node.js and Python. While it’s possible that you 
forget Java is supported, once you’ve identified two options that are 
valid, the answer must be D.</li>
<li>A, B. Elastic Beanstalk supports all RDS options as well as 
DynamoDB. Oracle running on EC2 is a nonstandard option so not suitable 
for the auto-provisioning of Elastic Beanstalk. Redshift is also not a 
database technology.</li>
<li>C. You can absolutely deploy to production using Elastic Beanstalk. 
You simply need to configure different Elastic Beanstalk environments to
 use different databases.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_193"></span>D.
 EC2 and ECS are compute services but require knowledge and working with
 the required resources. DynamoDB is a database and cannot run code. 
Lambda is correct: It runs code without needing an underlying set of 
compute resources that are user managed.</li>
<li>A, D. Elastic Beanstalk and Lambda are very different services, but 
in this context, both are valid answers. Elastic Beanstalk is a sort of 
“code deployment wizard,” and Lambda allows for serverless code 
deployment. Both handle provisioning of the environment without user 
intervention.</li>
<li>A. Code deployed via Lambda absolutely runs on servers; however, AWS abstracts the details away from user management.</li>
<li>A, B. You should know which languages and technologies are commonly 
used and cited by AWS and which are not. In general, Node.js, 
JavaScript, Java, PHP, and Perl are pretty commonly supported. C++ and 
Scala are not in that list.</li>
<li>B, C. A is a bit nonsensical. Installing Oracle requires using EC2 
instances, so is not a use case for Lambda. Both B and C are valid: 
Lambda is ideal for responding to triggers or changes in state from 
other AWS services and also handles scaling quite well without 
user-driven code. D is not valid; that is a use case for EC2 or the 
Elastic Container Service.</li>
<li>A. Conversion of files to various formats is transcoding and therefore the function of Elastic Transcoder.</li>
<li>B. QuickSight is a cloud-powered business analytics service. It provides visualizations and analysis from multiple data sources.</li>
<li>B. SNS is the Simple Notification Service and provides 
notifications—alerts and alarms—when certain events occur in your AWS 
environment.</li>
<li>A. AWS Cognito allows you to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access 
control to web applications, as well as single sign-on. It also allows 
identity providers such as Facebook and Google to be used.</li>
<li>B. Every region is a specific geographic area, but none are as big as an entire continent.</li>
<li>D. A VPC is a virtual private cloud. It is a virtual network dedicated to a single AWS account.</li>
<li>C. ECS is the Elastic Container Service. It manages containers 
(Docker) that are each compute resources and can be spun up and spun 
down quickly.</li>
<li>B. RDS is the Relational Database Service, which provides managed database services for your applications.</li>
<li>D. Route 53 is the DNS service managed by AWS. It provides domain management and registration.</li>
<li>D. A customer gateway allows an on-premises site to connect with AWS
 through a peer-to-peer VPN. It is a virtual networking device.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_194"></span>A.
 Anything related to S3 is going to be storage-related. In this case, 
lifecycle management handles transitioning data from one S3 storage 
class to another.</li>
<li>D. Amazon Lightsail is a compute solution for web applications and 
involves compute, storage, and networking as well as database storage 
when needed. It launches servers and configures them with the needed 
services for web hosting. Note that while AWS considers Lightsail a 
compute service, it absolutely interfaces and controls additional 
resources.</li>
<li>C. Elastic Beanstalk is an Amazon service that spins up and manages a
 number of other services, in particular, compute. Even though you can 
configure other services, though, Beanstalk is considered to primarily 
be a code deployment tool and therefore is focused on compute services.</li>
<li>A. EFS is the Elastic File System, a scalable file system concerned with storage.</li>
<li>C. Redshift is one of AWS’s OLAP (online analytics processing) tools
 and is a database service. While it does processing, it is primarily 
intended to receive large amounts of data and operate upon that data, as
 a database would (in loose terms).</li>
<li>B. CloudFront is AWS’s distribution network. It’s a content caching 
system that is ultimately a networking component of your AWS buildout.</li>
<li>D. Athena is a database and available through RDS but is ultimately 
intended for analytics, much like Redshift and Elastic MapReduce.</li>
<li>B. EMR is Elastic MapReduce and provides data processing and analysis of large datasets.</li>
<li>C. Cloud9 is a developer environment, intended as an IDE for AWS developers.</li>
<li>D. Direct Connect is an AWS service for creating a high-speed connection between an on-premises site and AWS.</li>
<li>D. Amazon Workspaces allows you to provide a desktop service via the
 cloud. The service allows people throughout the world to take advantage
 of scalable desktop provisioning.</li>
<li>B. Kinesis is a data analytic service capable of handling large data streams and providing real-time insights.</li>
<li>C. Elastic Transcoder processes video into formats suitable for a wide variety of devices across resolutions and formats.</li>
<li>D. OpsWorks is an operational management service, which AWS often 
classifies as “management tools” (especially in the AWS console). It 
allows integration with tools like Puppet and Chef.</li>
<li>A. Lex is the Amazon service for building voice recognition and conversation bots.</li>
<li>A. CloudWatch offers the ability to set up specific metrics (network
 throughput, requests, disk IO, and so on) and monitor those metrics via
 dashboards and reports.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_195"></span>D.
 An availability zone (AZ) is a virtual data center within a region, 
separated from other AZs by a distance sufficient to provide redundancy 
in the case of a disaster. B is incorrect as AZs do not have redundancy 
within them; that is the definition of a region.</li>
<li>B. A region is an area geographically that has redundancy within it,
 in the form of availability zones. Each AZ (which is defined in both A 
and C) is separate from other AZs and each is in essence a virtual data 
center.</li>
<li>A, B. AWS will always ask at least a few questions related to 
regions and availability zones. As long as you read these carefully, 
they should be easy correct answers. A region is a geographical area 
with redundancy within it, through at least two availability zones. 
Option A is false as services are not tied to regions. B is false 
because a region contains virtual data centers; it is not itself a 
virtual data center.</li>
<li>B, D. Availability zones are virtual data centers (which makes D false, as AZs do not <i>contain</i>
 data centers) and are isolated from each other except through 
low-latency network links. So C is true (and therefore incorrect), and A
 is true, as AZs definitely host compute resources. That leaves B in 
addition to D. B is not describing an AZ as an AZ does not itself 
provide redundancy. It’s the <i>combination</i> of AZs that does this work.</li>
<li>C, D. Elastic IPs are assigned to an instance in a specific 
availability zone, but in the event of a failure, that elastic IP can be
 remapped to another AZ, making A false. B is false because regions will
 contain <i>at least</i> two availability zones, not exactly two. C is 
true, as different accounts may remap AZs to different names to ensure 
better resource distribution, and D is correct, even though many users 
simply accept the defaults and don’t pick a specific AZ.</li>
<li>A, C. This is admittedly a tough question, but worth working 
through. You need to have at least a familiarity with AWS regions and 
know that there are several major regions: US, EU, and AP. There are a 
few others (CA, SA, for example), but the major ones are US, EU, and AP.
 Knowing those, you can spot that A and C are likely valid. JP 
(presumably for Japan) isn’t correct, and UK you should recognize should
 be EU. There is no UK-specific region.</li>
<li>B, D. This is more of a formatting question than knowing the list of
 AWS regions. A region identifier is the region name, which is usually 
the country or area (eu, us, etc.), then the geographical area 
(southeast, west, east, etc.), then a number. This makes B and D 
correct. A is the “human readable” name, and C is an availability zone, 
due to the letter appended to the end.</li>
<li>A. An availability zone identifier is the region identifier with a 
letter appended on the end. A region identifier is the region name, 
which is usually the country or area (eu, us, etc.), then the 
geographical area (southeast, west, east, etc.), then a number.</li>
<li>C. EFS, Elastic File System, provides scalable storage accessible 
from multiple compute instances. EBS is Elastic Block Storage and is 
tied to one instance at a time and therefore not like a NAS (network 
attached storage). DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, and tape gateway is a 
client device for interacting with S3, but locally rather than in the 
cloud.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_196"></span>C.
 Be careful here; while ElastiCache is an AWS service for caching, it 
uses memcached and redis for actual caching. Therefore, memcached is the
 engine, not ElastiCache.</li>
<li>A, C. ElastiCache uses two different caching engines: memcached and redis.</li>
<li>C. You can choose reserved instances for EC2 and RDS, so the correct answer here is C.</li>
<li>D. You can use reserved instances for almost anything AWS offers. 
This applies to RDS (in any configuration) as well as ElasticCache 
nodes.</li>
<li>A, B. First, you need to know that you can manually force a failover
 (option A). Then, realize that a Multi-AZ setup is for disaster 
recovery, so it would take a failure of the primary availability zone to
 fail over (option B). The secondary AZ does not cause a failover (C), 
nor does a specific number of failed reads (D).</li>
<li>A, D. You can approach this in two ways: by knowing what you can do, and knowing what you cannot. You <i>can</i> select the database type and the AZ to which you want your instance deployed (A and D). You <i>cannot</i> specify extremely detailed issues related to performance and failover (B and C).</li>
<li>A, B. This is a bit tricky. While I/O may briefly suspend, the 
database never goes completely offline (C). However, the I/O suspension 
can result in increased latency (A) and a slowing down of responses (B).
 However, network requests will still be fulfilled; they will not fail 
(D).</li>
<li>C, D. RDS supports Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
<li>A, D. RDS supports Multi-AZ deployments. Automated backups are turned <i>on</i>
 by default. Some RDS databases—notably Maria and Aurora—are only 
supported through a managed service like RDS. And all RDS databases 
provide a SQL interface.</li>
<li>D. MySQL is by default available on 3306. You can also remember that
 databases are typically only available on unreserved ports, above 1024.
 Ports below 1024 are reserved for privileged services.</li>
<li>A. OLAP is online analytics processing, often associated with 
business intelligence. AWS services like Redshift are ideal for OLAP.</li>
<li>D. OLTP is online transaction processing and is generally the domain of relational databases in AWS.</li>
<li>A. Redshift is the prime example of AWS providing an OLAP service.</li>
<li>D. Aurora, as a managed service via RDS, is a relational database, 
and relational databases are generally the best answer for OLTP in AWS.</li>
<li>B, D. In OLTP questions, look for the relational databases. In this 
question, those are Oracle and SQL Server, and therefore the answers. 
memcache is one of the engines for ElastiCache and DynamoDB is a NoSQL 
database.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_197"></span>D. Redshift provides data warehousing on AWS, which is closely associated with OLAP.</li>
<li>A. EMR, Elastic MapReduce, is ideal for big data processing. Is uses
 the Hadoop and Spark frameworks and is a managed service for processing
 very large datasets.</li>
<li>C. This is a little trickier. The best way to remember how to answer
 a question like this is to associate Kinesis with streaming data, which
 implies real-time analysis. Kinesis can take in streams of data and do 
immediate processing on that.</li>
<li>B. QuickSight doesn’t come up much in AWS study guides, but there is
 usually a single question on many AWS exams about it. QuickSight gives 
you “sight” into your application, which is the easiest way to remember 
it’s about visualization.</li>
<li>D. This is another tough question, especially if both Kinesis and 
Athena appear in the answer choices. Kinesis handles streams of data and
 does real-time analytics; Athena is more on the interactive side. 
Athena analyzes data but allows standard SQL queries. That’s why it’s a 
better choice than Kinesis with this question.</li>
<li>B, D. EMR, or Elastic MapReduce, is most commonly used with Hadoop 
and Spark. Unfortunately, this simply has to be memorized; there’s no 
good way to get at this unless you already know that Hadoop and Spark 
are ideal for data processing.</li>
<li>D. Aurora actually stores a whopping six copies of your data, across
 three availability zones, to ensure failover and disaster recovery.</li>
<li>B. Aurora actually stores a whopping six copies of your data, across
 three availability zones, to ensure failover and disaster recovery.</li>
<li>C. Aurora, under the RDS managed service, is about five times as 
fast as MySQL and three times as fast as PostgreSQL. Still, there’s an 
easier way to remember this: Anytime an AWS exam asks you about speed or
 performance, it’s generally the case that the AWS offering is the right
 answer. AWS won’t ask you to choose MySQL or Oracle as a faster option 
than one of its own databases!</li>
<li>A. Aurora, under the RDS managed service, stores six copies of your 
data by default, across three availability zones. Additionally, there’s 
an easier way to remember this: Anytime an AWS exam asks you about 
resilience, it’s generally the case that the AWS offering is the right 
answer.</li>
<li>B, C. Aurora is compatible with both PostgreSQL and MySQL. These are
 also easier to choose because they are both relational databases, also 
managed through RDS.</li>
<li>B, D. RDS provides for SQL interaction as well as access through the RDS web APIs. RDS instances do <i>not</i> allow access via SSH or RDP.</li>
<li>C. RDS allows backup retention periods up to 35 days.</li>
<li>A. You can’t use RDS because the question explicitly says you are 
installing Oracle on EC2 rather than using the managed service. In this 
case, then, you want the fastest disk space available, which will be 
EBS, Elastic Block Storage.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_198"></span>B,
 D. Anytime OLTP comes up, simply look for options that are 
RDS-supported databases, and if that fails, look for relational 
databases. In this question, the answers that fit these criteria are 
MariaDB and Aurora.</li>
<li>A, C. Anytime OLTP comes up, simply look for options that are 
RDS-supported databases, and if that fails, look for relational 
databases. In this question, the answers that fit these criteria are 
PostgreSQL and SQL Server. Since the question asks which are <i>not</i> suitable options, the correct selections are Kinesis (A) and Redshift (C).</li>
<li>A, C. A Multi-AZ setup provides disaster recovery options through a 
secondary database. This also implicitly provides data redundancy.</li>
<li>B, D. A read replica setup is intended to reduce the load on a 
single database instance by providing additional databases from which to
 read. This also has the “side effect” of reducing network latency via 
spreading out traffic across multiple instances.</li>
<li>A, C. A read replica setup is intended to reduce the load on a 
single database instance by providing additional databases from which to
 read. Applications can read from the replica (A) but not write to it 
(B). Only the primary instance—through RDS and AWS—can “write” changes 
to the replica (C).</li>
<li>C. Multi-AZ setups provide disaster recovery through a secondary 
instance (A and B), and all RDS databases support Multi-AZ (D). This 
just leaves C, which is not provided (and is the correct answer). 
Because only the primary instance is accessible, it is not any more 
performant than a standard RDS setup.</li>
<li>B. Multi-AZ setups use synchronous replication (B) to back up data 
to the secondary instance for the purposes of disaster recovery.</li>
<li>D. Read replicas use asynchronous replication (D), pushing data to 
the read replicas whenever possible, for improved read performance.</li>
<li>A. Read replicas are intended to provide scalability for your 
application by adding additional instances for increased reads from 
applications.</li>
<li>C. A Multi-AZ setup is about disaster recovery, and therefore 
durability. They provide automatic backups (so not A), upgrades happen 
on the primary database and then are replicated (so not B), and there is
 a primary and usually a single secondary instance (so not D). That 
leaves C: durability.</li>
<li>B. AWS provides up to five read replicas for a single database instance, configurable via the AWS console.</li>
<li>A, B. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, and RDS is required for read 
replicas (so A is correct, as it does not support read replicas). 
Redshift is not a database, but rather a data warehousing tool, so also 
should be selected. Both MySQL and MariaDB support read replicas through
 RDS.</li>
<li>A, C. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and does indeed offer 
“push-button” scaling (A). You can scale up the size of the database at 
any time, <i>without</i> needing to change the instance size (as you do with RDS instances). This makes C true.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_199"></span>B,
 C. DynamoDB is easier to scale than RDS as it does not require either 
read replicas or instance size changes to scale up, making A false. 
DynamoDB does use SSD drives, so B is true. It is also—according to AWS 
documentation—spread across three geographically distinct data centers, 
so D is correct.</li>
<li>A. DynamoDB uses eventually consistent reads by default, meaning a 
read might not immediately reflect the results of a very recent write. 
The remaining choices are not actual consistency models.</li>
<li>A, D. DynamoDB uses eventually consistent reads by default, meaning a
 read might not immediately reflect the results of a very recent write. 
It also offers a strongly consistent reads model, always reflecting the 
most recent write operations.</li>
<li>A, D. Delays occur in a strongly consistent read model when recently
 written data cannot be returned. Since a strongly consistent read model
 guarantees the latest data is returned, until that data is available, 
no response can be sent. This is the situation described in both option A
 and D. Option B involves replication, which is not relevant in this 
context, and C involves previous reads rather than writes.</li>
<li>D. VPCs put relatively few restrictions on the types and numbers of 
subnets supported. They can certainly support single and multiple 
private and public subnets alongside each other.</li>
<li>A, D. All instances in the default VPC get a public and private IP address by default at launch time.</li>
<li>C, D. All of the options are valid here. EC2 instances can have 
public and private addresses, elastic addresses, and both IPv4 and IPv6 
addresses.</li>
<li>B, C. There is no concept of a VPC peering with itself, and VPCs can
 only peer with other VPCs, not subnets. This makes A and D incorrect. 
VPCs <i>can</i> peer with other VPCs, in the same account or different ones (B and C).</li>
<li>A. A /16 offers 65,536 IP addresses. The lower the number, the larger the pool of IP addresses when using CIDR notation.</li>
<li>A. SWF stands for Simple Workflow, and Amazon SWF is the Amazon Simple Workflow Service.</li>
<li>D. SWF places no language restraints on your workflow, as long as interactions can be managed via HTTP requests and responses.</li>
<li>B. SWF provides an API, but it is neither the AWS-specific API nor 
language specific. Instead, SWF supports standard HTTP requests and 
responses.</li>
<li>D. SWF stands for Simple Workflow, an AWS managed service. That 
should be a clue that the key factor here is workflow management. Tasks 
are handled and coordinated across application components with SWF.</li>
<li>C. SWF is typically thought of as an asynchronous service, but it also supports synchronous tasking when needed.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_200"></span>B. SES is the Simple Email Service and is used for sending and receiving emails for AWS applications and services.</li>
<li>D. SQS is the Simple Queue Service. This should be a tip-off, but it’s actually <i>messaging</i> in the question that is the key word. SQS does provide queuing but is ultimately a queue-based message delivery system.</li>
<li>C, D. SNS is the Simple Notification Service and SQS is the Simple 
Queue Service. The two are not interchangeable (A is wrong). SNS pushes 
notifications, while SQS allows for pulls of its messages (so B is 
wrong, but D is correct). Finally, SNS handles notifications, and SQS 
handles messages (C is correct).</li>
<li>B, D. Worker nodes (D) can poll SQS for new messages (B) and then 
pull those messages when they are available. Tasks are associated with 
SWF, while notifications are associated with SNS.</li>
<li>B, C. SNS is a push-based service (C) that pushes notifications (B) to anything subscribed to an appropriate topic.</li>
<li>A, B. SWF is associated with tasks and is distinct from (for example) SQS, because it guarantees a single delivery of all tasks.</li>
<li>A, B. SNS provides topics that can be subscribed to; then 
notifications related to that topic are pushed to all the topic 
subscribers.</li>
<li>A. SWF tasks are assigned once and only once.</li>
<li>B. This is a bit esoteric, but even if you’re unsure, you should be 
able to reason this one out. A topic is simply a name or “category” to 
which subscribers can attach and receive notifications. Therefore, a 
linked list and a named message don’t make much sense. (They’re also 
constructs that are never seen in AWS documentation for the most part.) 
An IAM role is an AWS construct, but roles are related to permissions. 
This leaves only B, an Amazon Resource Name, which is correct.</li>
<li>D. SQS will guarantee that a message is delivered at least once, but that message may be redelivered.</li>
<li>C. A SWF domain is a collection of related workflows.</li>
<li>D. SQS queues only make an “attempt” to deliver messages in order 
(more or less a FIFO approach) but do not guarantee FIFO. If strict FIFO
 is needed, that option can be selected.</li>
<li>B. SQS queues only make an “attempt” to deliver messages in order 
(more or less a FIFO approach) but do not guarantee FIFO. If strict FIFO
 is needed, that option can be selected. Option B will ensure that 
orders are processed in the order in which they were received.</li>
<li>C, D. Other than the slightly odd answer choices (which sometimes 
comes up!), all VPCs can communicate with the hub, so C and D cover all 
the options.</li>
<li>B, D. Any spoke in a hub-and-spoke model can only directly 
communicate with the hub (option B), as well as any other peered VPCs 
(option D).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_201"></span>B,
 C. Any spoke in a hub-and-spoke model can only directly communicate 
with the hub (option B is true, while A is false). And the hub (VPC G) 
can communicate with all spokes (so C is true, but D is false).</li>
<li>C, D. Any spoke in a hub-and-spoke model can only directly 
communicate with the hub. This makes A and B true and C and D false; so 
the right answers are C and D.</li>
<li>B. NACLs are stateless—rules and must exist for inbound and 
outbound. Security groups are stateful—anything allowed in is allowed 
back out automatically.</li>
<li>A. NACLs are stateless—rules must exist for inbound and outbound—and
 security groups are stateful—anything allowed in is allowed back out 
automatically.</li>
<li>B. NACLs are stateless—rules must exist for inbound and outbound—and
 security groups are stateful—anything allowed in is allowed back out 
automatically.</li>
<li>B. ALBs are redundant across at least two subnets.</li>
<li>A, D. This is a little tricky. While the default VPC automatically 
creates a subnet, additional VPCs do not. You do automatically get a 
security group, route table, and NACL, so in this case, you’d want to 
choose options A and D.</li>
<li>C, D. The key here is “default VPC.” While subnets are not created 
in additional custom VPCs, the default VPC does get a subnet 
automatically (as well as an internet gateway). And all new VPCs get 
route tables, NACLs, and security groups.</li>
<li>A, C. The key here is “default VPC.” While subnets are not created 
in additional custom VPCs, the default VPC does get an internet gateway 
automatically (as well as a subnet). And all new VPCs get route tables, 
NACLs, and security groups.</li>
<li>A. This is really tough and requires pure memorization. The default 
VPC has a CIDR block of /16, but the default subnet in each AZ is a /20.</li>
<li>B. This is a case of rote memorization. Default VPCs get a /16 CIDR block assigned to them.</li>
<li>D. There is no default CIDR block for custom VPCs. While the default
 VPC has a /16 CIDR block, custom VPCs must have this entered in.</li>
<li>B. In general, the smaller the number after the slash, the larger 
the CIDR block. /16 is the largest valid block. A /16 offers 65,536 IPv4
 addresses.</li>
<li>C, D. Default VPCs have a default subnet, along with a NACL, security group, and internet gateway, and a route table as well.</li>
<li>B. The default VPC has an internet gateway, and instances are given 
public IP addresses, so option B is correct. You do not create the 
default VPC (A), and security groups control specific access, not the 
public or private nature of the VPC and instances within it (C).</li>
<li>A, B. The default VPC does have an internet gateway attached to it, but custom VPCs do not. This is an important exam topic!</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_202"></span>A,
 C. Option A is true for both the default and custom VPCs: All VPCs have
 NACLs automatically created. While all outgoing traffic is allowed out 
by default (C), incoming traffic is restricted by default (B)—this 
includes inbound HTTP traffic (D).</li>
<li>A, D. All VPCs have NACLs, security groups, and route tables 
automatically created. However, only the default VPC has a default 
subnet and an internet gateway created as well.</li>
<li>B, D. All VPCs have NACLs, security groups, and route tables 
automatically created. However, only the default VPC has a default 
subnet and an internet gateway created as well, different from the 
custom VPC.</li>
<li>B, C. All EC2 instances in the default VPC have both a public and private IP address. They do <i>not</i>
 have an elastic IP address, and the security group that is created by 
default does not allow any inbound traffic (until changed manually).</li>
<li>C, D. All EC2 instances in the default VPC have both a public and 
private IP address. Therefore, the only addition to serve web content 
would be to allow the web traffic in via security group.</li>
<li>C, D. Instances in any non-default VPCs need to be made public via 
an elastic or public IP (A), and the VPC itself needs an internet 
gateway (B). Further, you need to allow in web traffic via the security 
group (C). So this is an “All of the above” situation, translating into 
options C and D.</li>
<li>B, C. A VPC endpoint provides a connection over the Amazon network 
between your VPC and a service, such as S3 (B). This avoids leaving the 
network and routing over the public Internet, which inherently provides 
greater security for the traffic involved (C).</li>
<li>D. A VPC endpoint does not require any of these to connect; it is a 
private connection outside of these constructs altogether, which is part
 of why it is an attractive solution for internal AWS communication.</li>
<li>B, C. A VPC endpoint is a virtual device that provides redundancy 
via AWS (and automatically). This makes options B and C correct, and A 
wrong. VPC endpoints scale horizontally, not vertically.</li>
<li>B, D. A VPC endpoint can connect to S3 and DynamoDB, as well as a 
host of additional AWS services, so B is true. It does not require an 
internet gateway or a VPN connection and does not route traffic over the
 public Internet (D).</li>
<li>A, C. A VPC endpoint comes in two flavors: an interface endpoint, 
which provides an elastic network interface and a private IP address, 
and a gateway endpoint, targeted for a specific route in your route 
table.</li>
<li>A, D. This is pretty tough and is arguably right at the boundary of 
what the CSA Associate exam might ask. A gateway endpoint handles all 
traffic for a supported AWS service. Further, it’s not a specific 
portion of that service, so you can rule out a particular Kinesis data 
stream (C). That leaves A, B, and D. A and D make sense, while routing 
private traffic to Route 53 does not.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_203"></span>A,
 C. This is another tough question. An interface endpoint provides a 
private IP address for connecting to a specific entry point for a 
specific AWS service. Anything that’s more general—like DynamoDB—isn’t a
 valid candidate. Additionally, a VPN (B) doesn’t make sense, as a VPN 
is a different type of connection altogether. In this case, that leaves a
 specific API gateway and a specific Kinesis data stream (A and C).</li>
<li>C, D. Instances that take advantage of a VPC endpoint do not need to
 have a public IP address or use a NAT instance. Instead, assuming they 
have a route to the endpoint (D), they send traffic over the AWS network
 to the connected service (C).</li>
<li>C. The best way to remember this is to consider the process for 
creating an instance: you must select the security group for every 
instance. So security groups operate at the instance level (C).</li>
<li>A. Security groups only provide for allow rules (A). All other 
traffic is automatically denied, so allow rules are the only means of 
allowing traffic in.</li>
<li>A, C. Security groups disallow all traffic unless there are specific allow rules for the traffic in the security group.</li>
<li>A. Security groups evaluate all the rules on the group before deciding how to handle traffic.</li>
<li>D. Security groups evaluate all the rules on the group before deciding how to handle traffic.</li>
<li>B. Five VPCs are allowed per region, per account, unless you contact AWS to raise this default limit.</li>
<li>B. All custom VPCs have a route table (so A is false) and a NACL (so C is false) and will <i>not</i>
 have an internet gateway (D is false). This leaves B, which is true: 
subnets can communicate with each other across availability zones by 
default.</li>
<li>D. Only a bastion host (D) makes SSH available to private instances.
 You can use a NAT gateway or NAT instance to route traffic from these 
instances out, but a bastion host allows for SSH into private instances.</li>
<li>A, C. Both a NAT instance and a NAT gateway provide for outgoing 
traffic to route to the Internet from instances within a private subnet.</li>
<li>A. A VPC can only have a single internet gateway.</li>
<li>C. A single region can only have five VPCs by default, but this limit can be raised by contacting AWS.</li>
<li>C. A single VPC can have a single internet gateway. This limit isn’t based on region (D) but on VPC (C).</li>
<li>A, D. First, realize it’s possible that almost any of these answers 
could be a part of a larger solution. However, the question asks for the
 simplest—or most direct—solutions. Given that, the solutions that are 
best are giving the instances public IP addresses (D) and adding an 
internet gateway to the VPC. You also will likely need routes in and 
out, security groups, etc.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_204"></span>B,
 C. Given the internet gateway, the most likely issues are the instances
 being accessible via IP (which C addresses) and traffic for web/HTTP 
being disallowed (B).</li>
<li>D. VPCs can have a single internet gateway and multiple subnets. 
However, instances within a VPC with a public address have that address 
released when it is stopped and are reassigned a new IP when restarted.</li>
<li>B. A VPC can peer with unlimited other VPCs, so B is false. A subnet
 cannot span AZs, a VPC can peer with VPCs in other accounts, and a VPC 
having an internet gateway has no bearing on the public or private 
status of subnets within it.</li>
<li>D. All of the statements about NAT instances are false in A through 
C. Further, a NAT gateway is preferable to a NAT instance because it is 
managed by AWS rather than you, the architect.</li>
<li>D. A VPC cannot be changed from dedicated hosting tenancy to default hosting. You have to re-create the VPC.</li>
<li>A. Changes to a security group take place immediately. As a note, 
option D is a bit misleading. While security groups operate at various 
levels, they absolutely affect VPCs, so D is false.</li>
<li>A. This is a routing question. Instances need to have their outbound
 traffic directed to the internet gateway on the VPC, and then that 
traffic can flow outward to the Internet.</li>
<li>A. CloudFront supports both static and dynamic content.</li>
<li>A, C. With only the information presented, the best options are to 
focus on the database and the dynamic content; the web application 
servers (from the question’s limited information) are not the issue. 
That means look at the database instance size (A) and caching dynamic 
content (C). B and D focus on the web app instances, which would not 
appear to be the issue.</li>
<li>B, C. An internet gateway is required to handle Internet traffic, 
and a VPC endpoint is ideal for connecting the instances to S3. A 
customer gateway is used in setting up a VPN or site-to-site connection,
 and if NACL changes are required, you’d make them to the existing NACL,
 not a new one.</li>
<li>C, D. The key here is recalling that the default VPC already has an 
internet gateway attached, so you wouldn’t need one (B). A customer 
gateway is for a VPN or direct connection. This leaves C, a VPC endpoint
 for communication with S3, and D, updated NACL rules for the endpoint 
and the gateway (potentially).</li>
<li>A, D. The most likely culprits are the routing table of the VPC 
subnet and the virtual private gateway. A storage gateway (B) is not 
part of a Direct Connect solution, nor is a NAT instance (C).</li>
<li>B. Route propagation is a routing option that automatically 
propagates routes to the route tables so you don’t need to manually 
enter VPN routes. It’s most common in a Direct Connect setup. A is too 
broad a statement—not all routes are automatically copied. C is 
incorrect, and in D, a storage gateway is not part of a Direct Connect 
solution (it can be, but isn’t required).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_205"></span>B. This is a matter of rote memorization. All metadata for instances is available at <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://169.254.169.254/">http://169.254.169.254</a></span>, at <span class="codeLabel">/latest/meta-data</span>. <span class="codeLabel">/latest/instance-data</span> is actually not a URL that is responsive to requests.</li>
<li>A. S3 is highly durable and stores data as key-value pairs.</li>
<li>B. B is the only answer that doesn’t presume at least semi-frequent 
access. Glacier is best for files that are rarely accessed and do not 
require quick access times.</li>
<li>A, D. The best answer here is to enable MFA Delete (D). However, to 
do this, you’ll also need versioning (A). It is not practical to 
disallow developers from all delete access (B), and signed URLs do not 
help the issue.</li>
<li>C. For all new AWS accounts, 20 instances are allowed per region. 
However, you can increase this limit by requesting it via AWS support.</li>
<li>C. The only one of these that makes sense is C, increasing the size 
of the NAT instance. It is impossible to add an additional internet 
gateway to a VPC that already has one (A), and adding an additional 
elastic IP requires using a newer EC2 instance, and it will not affect 
performance in this case (B).</li>
<li>B. If instances are scaling up and down quickly, this means that the
 thresholds for adding and removing instances are being met frequently. 
Since you don’t want to reduce the scaling up to meet demand, you should
 increase what it takes for the system to scale down; that’s what B 
suggests. Proactive cycling (A) won’t help the situation and C is 
completely made up.</li>
<li>A, C. Routing is one of the most important steps (A); you must set 
the route to the public Internet to go to the NAT instance. 
Additionally, you need to disable source/destination checks, a commonly 
forgotten step (C). The NAT instance <i>cannot</i> be in a private subnet (B), and D doesn’t make sense in this context.</li>
<li>B. This is a tough one because it must simply be memorized. 
CloudWatch provides disk read operations, CPU usage, and inbound network
 traffic but does <i>not</i> provide memory usage by default.</li>
<li>A, B. The instance will need an elastic IP for public communication 
(A) and should be behind the same ELB as the other instances (B). Adding
 it into a private subnet (C) will remove its ability to communicate 
with the public Internet. D looks good, but if the instance is in the 
same subnet as the other instances, it automatically gets their routes; 
routing tables apply to the subnet, not a specific instance.</li>
<li>D. The public Internet is addressed via 0.0.0.0/0.</li>
<li>A. The public Internet is addressed via 0.0.0.0/0, so if that’s the 
destination, the target should be the internet gateway within the VPC.</li>

<ol id="capp-list-0002">
<li>D. There is no way to reason through this; it is a matter of 
memorization. There is no charge associated with data replication in 
this scenario.</li>
<li>C, D. All of these are valid options. Although it’s not particularly
 common, you can set up a read replica in an on-premises instance. 
Additionally, read replicas are often created in separate regions from 
the primary instance, to improve performance for clients closer to 
different regions than the primary instance.</li>
<li>C. A read replica configuration is aimed squarely at increasing 
database performance, specifically the performance of reading data from 
an RDS instance.</li>
<li>D. All three of these databases support read replicas. Most other 
databases supported by RDS (Oracle, for example, or Aurora) offer other 
approaches to gain similar functionality to read replicas but do not 
support the AWS read replica functionality.</li>
<li>B. Currently, read replicas in RDS are only supported by MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>A, C. A read replica is a read-only instance of a database created 
from a snapshot of the primary instance (A). Read replicas can be in the
 same instance, or a different one, as the primary instance (so B is 
false). Read replicas are updated via asynchronous replication—the most 
performant approach—from the primary database.</li>
<li>C, D. Read replicas can be in a different region than the primary 
instance (D), and they replicate all the databases in the primary 
instance (C). You can have up to five read replicas at a time for a 
single instance (so A is false). While MySQL and MariaDB are supported 
(B), Aurora is not.</li>
<li>D. The root issue here is that a read replica setup only allows for 
five read replicas. This is not a limit that can be raised by AWS either
 (so C is out). Option A won’t address the issue, and option B isn’t 
accurate; there are no EU limitations affecting the issue here. The only
 answer that would result in being able to create the instance is D: By 
turning off an existing instance, you can create a new fifth replica in 
the desired region.</li>
<li>C, D. Read replicas are focused on performance, so you can generally
 eliminate any answers related to disaster recovery—in this case, A. 
Read replicas work with RDS databases, as well, so B is out; on-premises
 databases aren’t supported. This leaves C and D, which are both valid.</li>
<li>B, C. No backups are taken from any instance automatically, 
including the primary instance, so A is false. Since each read replica 
has its own database instance running, both B and C are valid. 
Replication is asynchronous rather than synchronous (so D is false).</li>
<li>A, B. A is false because you can create read replicas in the same AZ
 as the primary instance. There is no requirement to use multiple AZs, 
as there is with a Multi-AZ setup. B is also false; read replicas 
provide no disaster recovery options. Both C and D are true.</li>

 Only A is correct. A Multi-AZ setup is focused on disaster recovery and
 fault tolerance, while read replicas provide performance and 
scalability.</li>
<li>D. There is no difference in how applications communicate with read 
replicas as compared to the communication with non-replica instances. In
 fact, applications don’t “know” that they’re communicating with a read 
replica other than an inability to make writes.</li>
<li>A, D. A and D are both solutions that would be aided by additional 
read-only instances. B is not a valid answer because updating records 
would still only be possible with the primary instance; read replicas 
don’t support writes. C is incorrect because read replicas do not 
provide automated fault recovery.</li>
<li>B. You need to be careful here. While read replicas are not 
advertised or even suggested as solutions for disaster recovery, option B
 does provide a somewhat manual process to use them in that manner. 
While you get no automated backups or failover (A or C), you can 
manually promote a read replica instance to a stand-alone instance if 
you have to. Still, a Multi-AZ setup is almost always a more robust 
solution for fault tolerance.</li>
<li>A, B. Both A and B are ideal situations for read replicas. C is the 
usual incorrect answer: read replicas don’t provide automated backups. 
And D is not accurate; the actual database processing doesn’t improve; 
you are merely adding more sources for reading data for clients.</li>
<li>D. AWS does not support circular replication through RDS. While some
 of the databases supported by RDS do, RDS itself does not provide 
access to this functionality.</li>
<li>A, C. You can create a read replica through the AWS console (A), the
 AWS API (C), and the AWS CLI (not mentioned, but still true).</li>
<li>B. As has been said numerous times, read replicas are not a backup 
strategy, nor do they cause automatic backups to be set up. However, you
 must turn on automatic backups for the primary database instance to 
enable read replicas.</li>
<li>A. This bears careful reading. Amazon RDS does not support circular 
replication, which means one database reads from a second database but 
then is replicated back by that second database. However, it is 
absolutely permissible for one database to replicate another database 
and then be the source for a third database. This makes option A 
correct.</li>
<li>D. There is no difference in response to a change in the backup 
window based on how that window is changed (API, console, etc.). All 
changes take place immediately.</li>
<li>B. This is another straight memorization question: Amazon RDS backups can be retained for up to 35 days, and no longer.</li>
<li>C. There are two components to this question: using RDS or EC2 for 
Oracle hosting and the class of storage to select. While RDS is a better
 option in the general case, it is likely not possible to use RDS in 
this scenario due to the custom plug-in required. This eliminates A and 
B. Given an installation on EC2, then, the question becomes which 
storage class is faster: provisioned IOPS or magnetic. The answer here 
is always provisioned IOPS.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_208"></span>B,
 C. Option C should be the immediately obvious first choice. Anytime you
 have custom plug-ins, you will likely need to install your database on 
an EC2 instance rather than using RDS. Options A and D are really both 
about network routes and services around your database, and both can be 
accomplished without affecting your EC2 vs. RDS decision. This leaves B,
 which also logically makes sense: If you have a very large database, 
and it will grow (as almost all databases do), then sizing restraints on
 RDS can be a limiting factor.</li>
<li>A, C. This should be an easy question if you’re prepared. While it’s
 easy to forget if Aurora and MariaDB are RDS options—they are!—you 
should know that DynamoDB is AWS’s NoSQL database, and Redshift is a 
data-warehousing solution.</li>
<li>A. This is not particularly difficult as long as you understand that
 a Multi-AZ deployment is concerned with failover, not performance. 
Option A is correct: There is no particular performance increase in a 
Multi-AZ deployment, unless read replicas are also turned on (which 
isn’t specified). B is false because only the primary database responds 
to requests in a Multi-AZ deployment. C is actually a true statement but
 does not have a bearing on the subject of the question: performance. 
And D doesn’t actually make sense in the context of the question at all!</li>
<li>A. This one is a little tricky as it requires understanding what 
default options AWS puts in place. By default, root volumes are 
terminated on instance deletion, and by default, additional EBS volumes 
attached to an instance are not. This makes option A true. However, note
 that these settings can be changed! Also note that option D is not true
 in any configuration.</li>
<li>B. The default for all new accounts is 100 allowed S3 buckets; this 
is consistent across AWS and does not change via configuration (meaning 
that C and D are not correct). However, this value can be raised through
 asking AWS for an exception and providing a reasonable justification, 
making B the correct answer.</li>
<li>B. Replication occurs synchronously from a primary instance to a 
secondary instance in a Multi-AZ setup. Asynchronous replication only 
occurs in a read replica setup (which can be enabled in addition to a 
Multi-AZ setup).</li>
<li>C. Replication occurs asynchronously from a primary instance to the 
various read replicas in a read replica setup. As a result, updates are 
not guaranteed to be instant on the read replicas. Synchronous 
replication occurs in a Multi-AZ setup.</li>
<li>A, B. Classic load balancers support both IPv4 and IPv6. They 
support HTTP/1 and HTTP/1.1, but only application load balancers support
 HTTP/2. Further, you must register individual instances, rather than 
target groups, with classic load balancers; registering target groups is
 a functionality only available with application load balancers.</li>
<li>A. AWS accounts allow you five elastic IP addresses per region by 
default. As with most AWS defaults, this can be raised by contacting AWS
 and providing a reasonable justification.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_209"></span>C.
 Officially, instances can have up to 28 attachments. One of those 
attachments is the network interface attachment, leaving 27 attachments 
available for EBS volumes. However, the better approach is to remember 
that an instance can attach to a root volume and several more volumes 
(more than two); this eliminates options A and B. Additionally, 
instances cannot have unlimited attachments. This leaves the correct 
answer, C.</li>
<li>A. Be careful with the wording, to ensure that you do not misread 
this as asking how many EBS volumes can be attached to an EC2 instance 
(a different question altogether). A single EBS volume can only be 
attached to one instance at a time.</li>
<li>B, C. This should be an easy answer: Application load balancers, as well as classic load balancers, only support HTTP and HTTPS.</li>
<li>A, C. RDS provides two (and only two) methods for backing up RDS 
databases at this point: automated backups and automated snapshots. S3 
lifecycle management policies are not applicable to RDS databases, and 
data pipeline is not relevant in this context.</li>
<li>B. Data written to and from cache is ephemeral, and if your instance
 is reading and writing that data frequently, the only way to ensure 
that your snapshot isn’t missing data is to stop the instance from 
running altogether and to then take a snapshot (B). Both A and C will 
take snapshots but will likely miss any cached data. With option D, you 
cannot detach a root volume from an instance (it’s unclear from the 
question if the cached data is being written to EBS, EFS, or another 
storage mechanism in any case), and so it is not a safe choice.</li>
<li>B, C. Option A is invalid because Multi-AZ is a disaster recovery 
solution; the primary database is the only instance that can respond to 
traffic in normal operation (unless read replicas are also set up). 
Option B is valid; caching user data would reduce round trips to the 
database and should reduce lag for users. Option C also makes sense, as 
having additional databases from which to read should decrease network 
latency to a single RDS instance. Option D is not helpful as the problem
 appears to be in retrieving credentials, not in the web tier itself.</li>
<li>C. Standard S3 (A) is not a bad choice, but is the most expensive, 
and both it and S3-IA (B) are more expensive than S3 One Zone-IA because
 of their increased availability and resilience. The key here is that 
photos can be lost without an issue, making S3 One Zone-IA the better 
option. S3 RRS is no longer recommended by AWS.</li>
<li>C. This should be automatic: Anytime a large data transfer is 
involved (especially on an AWS exam!), the answer should be Snowball. 
This comes up a lot and should be an easy correct answer.</li>
<li>A, D. The only tricky answer here is B. While Multipart Upload 
absolutely would improve the experience of uploading large files (larger
 than 10 GB, for example), it is not required; therefore, option B is 
not the best option to choose. Options A and D both are only possible 
with Multipart Upload enabled. Option C is false, as security is not 
related to Multipart Upload.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_210"></span>C.
 A placement group is concerned primarily with network throughput and 
reducing latency among EC2 instances within a single availability zone. 
AWS does support a placement group spanning multiple AZs via spread 
placement groups, but unless “spread” is specifically mentioned, you 
should assume the question references a “normal” (or “cluster”) 
placement group.</li>
<li>A, B. Cluster placement groups (the default type of placement group)
 must be made up of instances that exist within a single availability 
zone (A). This results in increased throughput for network activity (B) 
but does not affect actual disk performance when writing to S3 (C). 
Instances can also be of different types, so D is also false.</li>
<li>B, C. Spread placement groups can span availability zones and 
support up to seven instances per zone (C). Like cluster groups, this 
results in increased throughput for network activity (B). You must 
specify the distinct underlying hardware for spread placement groups, 
which means that D is false.</li>
<li>D. This is a question where the answer is nonintuitive. All the S3 
storage classes have the same durability. Even S3 One Zone-IA has 11 9s 
of durability in the single availability zone in which it resides.</li>
<li>A. Availability starts at 99.99% for S3 and then decreases to 99.9% 
for S3-IA, 99.5% for S3 One Zone-IA, and finally N/A for Glacier.</li>
<li>D. This question is easy if you recall that lifecycle transitions 
are concerned with moving between these storage classes. Therefore, all 
of these classes support those transitions.</li>
<li>A, C. All S3 and S3-IA data is stored in a single region and within 
at least three availability zones within that region. There is no 
“global” region for S3 storage.</li>
<li>C. Redshift is the only database or service in this list suitable 
for online analytics processing (OLAP). DynamoDB is an object database 
(NoSQL), and both Aurora and Oracle are relational databases, better 
suited for transaction processing.</li>
<li>B. All the major databases supported by RDS—MariaDB, SQL Server, 
MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL—allow up to 16 TB of storage for a 
provisioned IOPS volume.</li>
<li>A. A provisioned IOPS EBS volume is a solid-state drive that provides the highest performance volume.</li>
<li>B. A cold HDD is the cheapest EBS option, so B is correct. It is not
 solid state (A), it is not appropriate for data warehousing (C), and it
 is not available to be used as a boot volume.</li>
<li>A, D. This is easiest to remember by noting that HDD types are not 
available to use as boot volumes. The SSD types (A, D) are, and are 
correct.</li>
<li>B, D. A General Purpose SSD is the less-expensive SSD (compared to 
provisioned IOPS), so B is a valid answer. It also provides low-latency 
performance and is bootable. Option A is more suitable for provisioned 
IOPS, and C is better for a throughput-optimized HDD.</li>
<li>A, B. Magnetic volumes are older and generally not used much. They 
are ideal for saving money (A) or for infrequently accessed data (B).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_211"></span>B,
 C. Provisioned IOPS volumes are not inexpensive (A) but are well-suited
 for critical database workloads and throughput (B and C).</li>
<li>A, C. An SSD volume is best for transactional workloads (A) with a large number of small I/O sized read/write operations.</li>
<li>B, D. An HDD-backed volume is best for streaming workloads where throughput needs to be maximized over IOPS.</li>
<li>C. While it is possible that a General Purpose SSD might be 
sufficient to support an Oracle installation that doesn’t do a lot of 
processing, the best option is C, a provisioned IOPS SSD. Provisioned 
IOPS handles transaction processing well and will handle the large 
number of reads and writes that an Oracle installation would need.</li>
<li>A. This use case is one where access needs to be minimal, as does 
cost. If you have infrequently accessed data and cost is a major driver,
 magnetic drives might be a good option. While throughput-optimized HDDs
 are still cheaper than SSDs, magnetic is the cheapest option and would 
work fine for a set of data that is accessed without high performance 
needs.</li>
<li>A, C. You can boot an EC2 instance off any SSD type, as well as the 
magnetic type. HDD options are not available to use as boot volumes.</li>
<li>B, C. The HDD EBS volume types are not available to use as boot volumes, so B and C are the correct answers.</li>
<li>C. There is no such thing as a weighting load balancer. The other options are actual options.</li>
<li>A, C. An ELB is an elastic load balancer and generally refers to a 
classic load balancer. An ALB is an application load balancer. So A and C
 are valid; MLB and VLB are not acronyms or abbreviations for load 
balancers.</li>
<li>C. An ALB operates at Level 7, the individual request (application) 
level. Network load balancers operate at Level 4, the connection 
(transport) level. No load balancers operate at Level 1, and there is no
 Level 8 in the TCP/OSI stack.</li>
<li>B. An ALB operates at Level 7, the individual request (application) 
level. Network load balancers operate at Level 4, the connection 
(transport) level. No load balancers operate at Level 1, and there is no
 Level 8 in the TCP/OSI stack.</li>
<li>B, C. Classic load balancers operate at both the connection (Level 
4) and the request (Level 7) layer of the TCP stack. An ALB operates at 
Level 7, the individual request level. Network load balancers operate at
 Level 4, the connection (transport) level.</li>
<li>D. With the newer features of an ALB, all of these use cases are 
supported. It is important to recognize that ALBs can balance across 
containers, making B true, and pointing you to D: all of the above.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_212"></span>B.
 This is a difficult question, and right at the edges of what the 
Architect exam might ask. However, it is possible to use a load balancer
 to operate within a VPC. It can be pointed internal, instead of 
Internet-facing, and distribute traffic to the private IPs of the VPC.</li>
<li>B. ALBs offer the most flexibility in routing and load distribution.</li>
<li>C. Network load balancers can handle the extremely high request load
 mentioned in the question as well as route between static IP addressed 
instances.</li>
<li>B. An ALB offers SSL termination and makes the SSL offload process 
very simple through tight integration with SSL processes. While an ELB 
will handle SSL termination, it does not offer the management features 
that ALBs do.</li>
<li>D. Both ALBs and ELBs offer SSL termination. While an ALB is a 
better choice when considering the management of SSL certificates—due to
 its ACM integration—both ELBs and ALBs are correct when considering 
just SSL termination.</li>
<li>D. Route 53 supports up to 50 domain names by default, but this limit can be raised if requested.</li>
<li>D. Route 53 supports all of the records mentioned, including alias records.</li>
<li>A. Route 53 does support zone apex (naked) domain records.</li>
<li>A, B. ElastiCache offers two engines: memcached and redis. Neither C nor D are even real things!</li>
<li>D. ElastiCache, when used through AWS, handles all of these tasks 
and more: hardware provisioning, software patching, setup, 
configuration, monitoring, failure recovery, and backups.</li>
<li>B, D. This is another example of an odd answer set, which sometimes 
appears on the AWS exam. In this case, all answers are valid, which 
means choosing two: B and D (D references the remaining two, A and C)!</li>
<li>A, C. ElastiCache is an in-memory data store (A) that shards across 
instances (C). It is not in itself a data distribution mechanism, which 
is why B is not correct. And it is not a monitoring solution at all (D).</li>
<li>D. CloudFront allows interaction via CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, 
the AWS console, the AWS CLI, the AWS APIs, and the various SDKs that 
AWS provides.</li>
<li>A, C. CloudFront can front a number of AWS services: AWS Shield, S3, ELBs (including ALBs), and EC2 instances.</li>
<li>B, C. CloudFront can front a number of AWS services: AWS Shield, S3, ELBs (including ALBs), and EC2 instances.</li>
<li>A, B. CloudFront can front a number of AWS services: AWS Shield, S3,
 ELBs (including ALBs), and EC2 instances. It also most recently 
supports <a href="mailto://Lambda@Edge">Lambda@Edge</a> as an origin.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_213"></span>A,
 C. This is a bit difficult, as CloudFront is typically associated with 
performance (A), and not a lot else. However, CloudFront also provides 
deep integration with many managed AWS services, such as S3, EC2, ELBs, 
and even Route 53.</li>
<li>B, D. CloudFront automatically provides AWS Shield (standard) to 
protect from DDoS, and it also can integrate with AWS WAF and AWS Shield
 advanced. These combine to secure content at the edge. HTTPS is not 
required (so A is incorrect), and there is no KMS involvement with 
CloudFront (C).</li>
<li>B, D. Edge locations number more than both regions and availability zones.</li>
<li>A, C. CloudFront is easy to set up and lets you create a global 
content delivery network without contracts (A). It’s also a mechanism 
for distributing content at low latency (C). Creating websites and the 
actual file storage reference in B and D are not features of CloudFront 
but of LightSail (for example) and S3, respectively.</li>
<li>A, B. CloudFront can serve static content from S3 and dynamic content generated by EC2 instances.</li>
<li>B. When you create a CloudFront distribution, you register a domain 
name for your static and dynamic content. This domain should then be 
used by clients.</li>
<li>A, C. CloudFront will always handle requests that it receives. It 
will either return the requested content if cached (A) or retrieve that 
content by requesting it from an origin server (C). It will not redirect
 the client (D), nor will it pass the request on directly (B).</li>
<li>C, D. Both A and B are true. C is not, as routing will occur to the 
nearest edge location to the client, not the origin server. D is false; 
RDS is not a valid origin server for CloudFront.</li>
<li>D. There is no charge associated with data moving from any region to a CloudFront edge location.</li>
<li>A, B. S3 stores files and CloudFront stores copies of files, so A is
 true. Both also encrypt their files (B) as needed. Only CloudFront 
caches files (C), and only CloudFront can guarantee low-latency 
distribution (D).</li>
<li>B, D. CloudFront can store and serve both static (HTML and CSS, 
option D) and dynamic (PHP, option B) content. SQL queries cannot be 
directly returned, nor can an actual Lambda function. You can front the 
result of a <a href="mailto://Lambda@Edge">Lambda@Edge</a> function, but not the function itself.</li>
<li>A, B. CloudFront supports a variety of origin servers, including a 
non-AWS origin server (A). It supports EC2 (B), regardless of region, as
 well. It does not support RDS or SNS.</li>
<li>A. An edge location is a data center that delivers CloudFront content. Edge locations are spread across the world.</li>
<li>B. A distribution is the setup including your origin servers and how
 the content from those servers is distributed via CloudFront. It does 
not specifically refer to cached content at any given point in time.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_214"></span>D. Edge locations check for updated content every 24 hours by default, but this value can be changed.</li>
<li>A. Edge locations can be set to have a 0-second expiration period, which effectively means no caching occurs.</li>
<li>B, C. The most obvious culprit is a very low expiration period (B). 
Ensure that time is not close to 0. Beyond that, it’s possible 
that—especially in conjunction with a very low expiration period—your 
compute resources or storage resources are getting flooded with 
requests. Consider using additional origin servers.</li>
<li>A. Setting an expiration period to 0 expires all content (A). It 
actually would slow down response time and has nothing to do with DDoS 
attacks. While it would technically always return the most current 
content (D), that’s not a good reason to take this step; it defeats the 
purpose of CloudFront if the period is left at that value.</li>
<li>B, C. First, there is no mechanism either in the AWS console (A) or 
the AWS CLI (D) to interact directly with files on CloudFront 
distributions or edge locations. Second, the correct solution is to 
remove the file and then wait for the expiration period to cause a 
reload—which can be forced by setting that time to 0.</li>
<li>C. You need to remove a file from CloudFront’s origin servers before
 doing anything else, because files are replicated from the origin 
server. If the file exists, it will end up on an edge location. Then, 
with the file removed, the expiration period can be set to 0, and the 
cache will be updated—resulting in the file being removed.</li>
<li>C. The invalidation API is the fastest way to remove a file or object, although it will typically incur additional cost.</li>
<li>A. S3 will always be the most available S3 storage class. This should be an easy correct answer.</li>
<li>D. This can be a bit tricky. While S3 is more available, all the 
S3-based storage classes provide the same first byte latency: 
milliseconds. Remember that performance is identical; availability is 
not.</li>
<li>D. This is another semi-trick question. With the exception of 
Glacier, retrieving data from the various S3 storage classes should be 
virtually identical (network issues notwithstanding). The classes differ
 in availability, but not in how fast data can be accessed. (They also 
differ in terms of charging for the number of accesses of that data.)</li>
<li>C. Glacier data retrieval, using the standard class, takes 3–5 hours on average.</li>
<li>B. The difference between S3 and S3-IA is cost, and frequency of 
access (B). Retrieval is just as fast as S3 (so A is wrong), and data in
 S3-IA is stored redundantly (C and D).</li>
<li>C, D. C and D are both false. RDS instances cannot be origin servers, and the default expiration period is 24 hours, not 12.</li>
<li>D. CloudFront allows all of these as origin servers: S3, EC2 instances, ALBs, etc.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_215"></span>D. A collection of edge locations is a distribution.</li>
<li>C. An RTMP distribution is the Adobe Real-Time Messaging Protocol 
and is suitable for using S3 buckets as an origin server to serve 
streaming media.</li>
<li>A, C. CloudFront supports both web distributions and RTMP 
distributions. Media and edge distributions are not valid distribution 
types.</li>
<li>A, B. You can read and write objects directly to an edge location. 
You cannot delete or update them directly; only the CloudFront service 
can handle that.</li>
<li>A, D. ElastiCache is ideal for high-performance and real-time 
processing as well as heavy-duty business intelligence. It does not 
shine as much with offline transactions, where speed is less essential, 
and it’s not at all suitable for long-term or record storage.</li>
<li>B, D. Consider ElastiCache as only useful for storing transient 
data. Further, it’s not a persistent store; therefore, it’s great for 
caching data from a database or message service.</li>
<li>A, C. Consider ElastiCache as only useful for storing transient 
data. Further, it’s not a persistent store; therefore, it’s great for 
caching data from a message queue or providing very fast ephemeral 
storage.</li>
<li>A. ElastiCache uses shards as a grouping mechanism for individual 
redis nodes. So a single node is part of a shard, which in turn is part 
of a cluster (option A).</li>
<li>D. A storage gateway using cached volumes will cache frequently accessed data while storing the entire dataset on S3 in AWS.</li>
<li>C. A storage gateway using stored volumes will store all data locally while backing up the data to S3 in AWS as well.</li>
<li>C. A storage gateway using stored volumes will store all data 
locally, while all the other solutions store data in the cloud. 
Accessing local data will always be faster than accessing cloud data.</li>
<li>A. A storage gateway using stored volumes will store all data 
locally, providing low latency access to that data. Further, the entire 
dataset is backed up to S3 for disaster recovery. S3 is durable and 
available, but not as fast as accessing local data. A VTL provides a 
tape backup interface, but not necessarily fast data access.</li>
<li>B. The problem here is trying to tag individual folders. You can use
 IAM for permissions, but a particular folder cannot be tagged 
separately from other folders; only an entire bucket can be tagged.</li>
<li>D. A customer gateway with stored volumes provides the lowest 
latency for file access. A cached volume would not work because the 
majority of the files are the concern rather than just a small subset.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_216"></span>A.
 Configuring read replicas throughout all regions would provide the best
 response time on reads for customers spread across those same regions 
(A). While using multiple regions does provide some disaster recovery 
help, read replicas are really not a particularly effective disaster 
recovery approach. As for option C, read replicas do not increase 
network throughput; they just spread load out over the replicas, which 
may or may not desaturate the networks involved.</li>
<li>C. Read replicas are ultimately about providing faster read access 
to clients. If all your clients are in one region, then there is little 
advantage to adding read replicas to additional regions. Instead, 
providing replicas in the same region as the clients gives them the 
fastest access (C).</li>
<li>B. An argument could be made for option A here; customers will not 
be routed to a different region than the closest one if there are 
resources in a close region (so C is wrong) and D doesn’t make much 
sense here. However, it is possible that if the primary region failed 
altogether, you could convert a replica in another region to a primary 
database, meaning that B has some merit.</li>
<li>A, D. Read replicas can be backed up manually, and of course read 
from. However, they effectively become read-only instances, so cannot be
 written to. You also cannot fail over to a read replica. You can 
convert it to a stand-alone instance, but that is a manual process that 
is not a failover. Therefore, A and D are correct.</li>
<li>A, D. This is a tough question because there is not much context 
other than knowing the database is not performing well, in a general 
sense. However, of the options given, switching to DynamoDB and adding 
Multi-AZ would do little to improve performance. (Note that switching to
 DynamoDB could help, as DynamoDB auto-scales to handle load, but this 
is still not the best of the available answers). Adding read replicas 
and looking at bigger instances are safer and better answers given this 
limited context.</li>
<li>C, D. Only C and D would have a guaranteed effect here. While it is 
possible that S3 would deliver the PDFs faster, you’d still have heavy 
network traffic over AWS, and there’s no guarantee given the information
 here that S3 would be faster than RDS. B looks appealing, but note that
 the files are not accessed frequently. This means that caching is not 
going to help response time, as the files aren’t accessed enough for 
caching to kick in and be effective. The best options are setting up 
read replicas and looking at beefing up the database instance.</li>
<li>B, C. There are typically a lot of “the database is being 
overwhelmed” questions on the exam, and this is one of those. The key 
here is understanding that data is accessed infrequently, meaning that 
caching solutions (A and D) likely won’t help. Further, the staff is 
on-site, meaning that a customer gateway (C) could be a valid solution. 
Finally, it’s almost always safe to at least consider upgrading the 
database instance.</li>
<li>B. Here, the key details are infrequent data access and a 
geographically distributed customer base. This means that read replicas 
spread out across the country are the best bet (B). Caching won’t help, 
so A and D are out, and a storage gateway won’t help customers that 
aren’t accessing the data on-site.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_217"></span>D.
 This is a tough question, as several answers are valid. However, the 
key consideration here is that a single image is accessed several 
thousand times a day. Rather than adding instance power or read replicas
 (A and B), caching the images is the best approach, as it reduces 
overall database reads. In general, pulling an image from a cache (D) is
 far faster than performing a database read.</li>
<li>A, C. Route 53 offers a number of different routing policies: 
simple, failover, geolocation, geoproximity, latency-based, multivalue 
answer, and weighted.</li>
<li>A, B. Route 53 offers a number of different routing policies: 
simple, failover, geolocation, geoproximity, latency-based, multivalue 
answer, and weighted.</li>
<li>B, C. Route 53 offers a number of different routing policies: 
simple, failover, geolocation, geoproximity, latency-based, multivalue 
answer, and weighted.</li>
<li>C. Simple routing is ideal for sending all traffic to a single resource.</li>
<li>B. Failover routing is used to send traffic to a single resource but
 then to failover routing to a secondary resource if the first is 
unhealthy.</li>
<li>C. Geolocation routing uses the location of a user’s DNS query to determine which route to use.</li>
<li>B. Latency-based routing uses the latency of regions to determine where routing should direct users.</li>
<li>C. Multivalue answer routing can direct requests to multiple resources and also performs health checks on those resources.</li>
<li>D. Weighted routing uses predefined weights to determine how traffic is routed across multiple resources.</li>
<li>A. When there is a single resource to which traffic should be directed, simple routing is the best option.</li>
<li>A, C. The two options here that are valid are geolocation and 
geoproximity routing, both of which consider the location of the user 
before routing that user to a resource. Geographical routing is not a 
valid routing policy for Route 53.</li>
<li>D. Weights are simply integers that can be summed to determine an 
overall weight and the fractional weights of each resource to which 
traffic is directed.</li>
<li>C. A weight of 0 removes the resource from service in a weighted routing policy.</li>
<li>A. In a weighted routing policy, the numerical weights are added up,
 and each resource’s weight is divided by the sum of all the weights. In
 this case, the total weight is 400, so A is 25% of that (100/400), B is
 25% (100/400), and C is 50% (200/400).</li>
<li>A, C. A simple routing policy allows single and multiple resources 
for both the primary and secondary resources, so A and C are true. 
Weighted policies do honor health checks (so B is false), and D is 
inaccurate as weight numbers do not affect health checks.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_218"></span>A,
 B. The issues here are geographical proximity from EU users and load on
 the database, which has high CPU utilization. Therefore, those problems
 must be addressed. ElastiCache (A) should reduce load on the RDS 
instance, and CloudFront (B) caches responses in a way that should serve
 EU users more quickly.</li>
<li>B, D. This is another memorization question. Valid instance types 
begin with T, M, C, R, X, Z, D, H, I, F, G, and P. Frankly, it’s hard to
 memorize these; the questions like this aren’t frequent, but they can 
sometimes appear. In this case, E and Q are not valid instance type 
prefixes.</li>
<li>B. IAM offers permissions for AWS resources as well as access rights for users of the AWS platform.</li>
<li>A, C. IAM controls permissions for resource-to-resource interaction 
as well as user access to the AWS console. It does not provide an 
authentication interface or single sign-on.</li>
<li>B. IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.</li>
<li>A, C. IAM only applies to permissions for users, roles, and groups 
and does not affect billing or cost or specific application feature 
accessibility.</li>
<li>B, C. IAM does handle user permissions for accessing AWS (A) and 
EC2-to-S3 access (D), so these are both true and therefore incorrect. It
 does not handle hosted application permissions (B) or relate to SNS, 
making B and C the correct answers.</li>
<li>B. IAM is not the managed service for handling MFA Delete setup on S3 buckets.</li>
<li>B. Anytime a single account in AWS is shared, you likely have a security risk.</li>
<li>C. The only requirement here is creating a sign-in link that is not 
the same as the root sign-in link. Turning on MFA for the root or all 
accounts is not required, and while it is common to create an IAM group 
at this stage, it is not required for access.</li>
<li>A, B. Users, groups, roles, permissions, and similar constructs are 
part of IAM. Organizations and organizational units are part of AWS 
Organizations, a different facility.</li>
<li>A, D. Users, groups, roles, permissions, and similar constructs are part of IAM.</li>
<li>A, C. In this case, you’d need to create a role that allows an EC2 
instance to communicate with another AWS service, in this case S3. While
 a default role would probably cover this use case, you might also write
 a custom policy if you had particular needs for something other than 
the default role’s allowances.</li>
<li>A, D. You can provide console access and programmatic access via IAM. Programmatic access incudes API and CLI access.</li>
<li>A, C. There are four types of policies in IAM: identity-based, 
resource-based, organization SCPs, and access control lists (ACLs).</li>
<li>B. IAM policies are written in JSON.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_219"></span>A,
 C. IAM policies can be attached to users, groups, and roles in the case
 of identity-based policies, and AWS services and components via 
resource-based policies.</li>
<li>B. MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication and can be enabled on a user account by IAM.</li>
<li>A, C. IAM aids in scalability primarily by consolidating and 
centralizing management of permissions, both to AWS users (A) and from 
instances to services (C).</li>
<li>C, D. IAM provides permissions, groups, users, and roles, and AWS 
Organizations provides logical groupings and account management. Both 
operate across all AWS resources.</li>
<li>C. Power user access is a predefined policy that allows access to 
all AWS services with the exception of group or user management within 
IAM.</li>
<li>D. Root users can perform all actions related to IAM.</li>
<li>A. Power users can work with managed services, but they cannot create (or otherwise manage) IAM users.</li>
<li>B. Although it might sound odd, AWS strongly recommends you delete 
your root user access keys and create IAM users for everyday use.</li>
<li>A, C. As a starting point, always consider that the root account is 
typically required for account-level operations, such as closing an 
account (A). It’s also needed for very privileged access; in this case, 
that’s creating a CloudFront key pair, which essentially provides signed
 access to applications and is a very trusted action. IAM does allow you
 to distribute user and policy management (B and D).</li>
<li>A, B. Affecting another account is generally something that requires
 root account level access. In this case, that’s D, as well as 
restoration of user permissions (C). Both A and B are available to 
non-root users.</li>
<li>D. It is impossible to remove access for the AWS account’s root user.</li>
<li>C. This is a bit of a “gimme” question but sometimes comes up. AWS 
firmly believes that root account access should be highly limited, but 
also not confined to a single user. C, having a very small group of 
engineers (ideally AWS certified) is the best approach to reducing root 
account level access as much as possible.</li>
<li>D. AWS defines and keeps updated a number of IAM policies for users, including Administrator, Billing, and Power User.</li>
<li>A, C. You will always need to provide non-root sign-in URLs for new 
users, so A is essential. The remaining answers are concerned with 
permissions, and of the choices (B, by the way, isn’t an actual option),
 the Developer Power User policy is a much better fit than the View-Only
 User policy.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_220"></span>D.
 Unless your manager is both highly technical and working on actual 
development issues, D is the best option: It provides View-Only access 
to AWS without adding unneeded privileges for the manager.</li>
<li>D. The Data Scientist policy is designed for just this purpose: 
running queries used for data analytics and business intelligence</li>
<li>A. This is a System Administrator role. While Power User would give 
permissions to the same services, it is likely too permissive. Remember,
 the key with these questions is to find the role that allows the 
specified operations without going beyond those any more than is 
necessary.</li>
<li>B, C. It is impossible to remove a root user’s access to EC2 
instances (B). Further, IAM is concerned with the raw AWS resources, not
 access to running web applications (C).</li>
<li>D. IAM changes apply immediately to all users across the system; there is no lag, and no need to log out and back in (D).</li>
<li>A. New users have no access to AWS services. They are “bare” or 
“empty” or “naked” users, in that it is merely a login to the AWS 
console (if a URL is provided). They cannot make any changes to AWS 
services or even view services.</li>
<li>C, D. New users have no access to AWS services. They will need a URL
 to use for logging in (C) and permissions via a valid AWS group such as
 Administrators or power users. Options A and B refer to groups that are
 not predefined by AWS.</li>
<li>A, B. To access the console, users need a sign-in URL (A) and a 
username and password. This is not the access key ID and secret access 
key referenced in B. Therefore, A and B would effectively block a user 
from accessing the console. There is no Log In To Console box for users.</li>
<li>C. AWS usernames have to be unique across the AWS account in which that user exists.</li>
<li>B, D. Programmatic access requires an access key ID and a secret 
access key pair. Usernames and passwords are used for console access.</li>
<li>A, C. Console access requires a username and password. Access keys 
and pairs are used for programmatic access, not console access.</li>
<li>B. IAM policy documents are written in JSON.</li>
<li>A. Of these, SSO is single sign-on, IAM is more generally applied 
here, and JSON is the language used for policy documents. But SAML, the 
Security Assertion Markup Language, is used directly to implement single
 sign-on.</li>
<li>C. If you have an external Active Directory, you’d want to federate 
those users into AWS. This allows you to use the existing user base, not
 re-create each individual user.</li>
<li>D. A policy document is a collection of permissions in IAM.</li>
<li>D. IAM users are global to an AWS account and are not region-specific.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_221"></span>C. Like IAM users, policy documents are global. There are no changes or steps you need to take to make these work globally.</li>
<li>A, B. Auto Scaling is most focused on capacity management (B), 
ensuring that your applications can perform by keeping the capacity 
sufficient. Further, it performs a minimal amount of monitoring to 
effect this (A). It does not limit cost, although it does help in cost 
reduction, and it has nothing to do with permissions management.</li>
<li>A, C. Auto Scaling helps you to quickly set up scaling (C) and to 
then keep costs to a minimum (A). It does not affect network 
performance, and while there is a reduction of overhead, this is not 
related to maintaining individual VPCs (D).</li>
<li>A, C. Auto Scaling can be applied to both Aurora (and specifically read replicas) and DynamoDB.</li>
<li>A, D. EC2 instances as well as ECS containers can both be scaled up and down by Auto Scaling.</li>
<li>C. A collection of components, such as EC2 instances that will grow and shrink to handle load, is an Auto Scaling group.</li>
<li>B, D. When creating an Auto Scaling group, you can specify the 
minimum and maximum size as well as a desired capacity and scaling 
policy. You cannot specify how many instances to add at once, nor the 
desired cost.</li>
<li>A, B. When creating an Auto Scaling group, you can specify the 
minimum and maximum size as well as a desired capacity and scaling 
policy. While you can specify triggers that are used to grow or shrink 
the group, you can not specify a memory allocation or a minimum 
processing threshold (neither is an actual AWS term).</li>
<li>B, C. A launch configuration contains an AMI ID, key pair, instance type, security groups, and possibly a block device mapping.</li>
<li>B, C. A launch configuration contains an AMI ID, key pair, instance 
type, security groups, and possibly a block device mapping. Cluster size
 is not part of a launch configuration, although a maximum number of 
instances can be added to an Auto Scaling group. Maximum memory 
utilization also is not part of a launch configuration but can be a 
trigger for scaling.</li>
<li>A, C. There are a number of valid scaling policies for Auto Scaling:
 Maintain current instance levels, manual scaling, schedule-based 
scaling, and demand-based scaling.</li>
<li>A, D. There are a number of valid scaling policies for Auto Scaling:
 Maintain current instance levels, manual scaling, schedule-based 
scaling, and demand-based scaling. Resource-based scaling and 
instance-based scaling are not actual scaling policy options.</li>
<li>D. You can choose to maintain current instance levels at all times. 
This is essentially ensuring that no instances are added unless an 
instance fails its health checks and needs to be restarted or replaced.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_222"></span>A.
 Demand-based scaling allows you to specify parameters to control 
scaling. One of those parameters can be CPU utilization, so this is the 
policy you’d use for this use case.</li>
<li>B. This one should be pretty easy. Schedule-based scaling allows you
 to specify a particular time period during which resources should scale
 up or down.</li>
<li>C. Manual scaling allows you to specify a minimum and maximum number
 of instances as well as a desired capacity. The Auto Scaling policy 
then handles maintaining that capacity.</li>
<li>A. Manual scaling allows you to specify a minimum and maximum number
 of instances as well as a desired capacity. You would specify a time to
 scale up for a schedule-based policy and maximum CPU utilization as 
well as scaling conditions for a demand-based policy.</li>
<li>A, C. The most common approach is to use CloudWatch triggers—such as
 memory or CPU utilization—to notify AWS to scale a group up or down. 
However, you can also manually scale up or down with the AWS console.</li>
<li>C. While you can remove the instance altogether (B), you’d 
eventually want to put it back in the group, meaning you’re incurring 
extra work. The best approach is to put the instance into Standby mode. 
This allows the group to scale up if needed, and then you can 
troubleshoot the instance and then put it back into the InService state 
when complete.</li>
<li>C, D. InService and Standby are valid states for an instance, while Deleted and ReadyForService are not.</li>
<li>B. You have to create a launch configuration first, then an Auto 
Scaling group, and then you can verify your configuration and group.</li>
<li>B. A launch configuration needs a single AMI ID to use for all instances it launches.</li>
<li>D. Security groups work for launch configurations just as they do with instances: You may use as many as you like.</li>
<li>D. All of these are valid options for creating an Auto Scaling group.</li>
<li>B, C. All of these are acceptable options, but the best options are 
to use the existing EC2 instance as a basis for a new Auto Scaling group
 and to set up demand-based scaling. Anytime you have an existing 
instance that is working, you can simply start from there, rather than 
using a launch configuration and duplicating the setup. Demand-based 
scaling will respond to changing conditions better than having to 
manually scale up and down or to set a desired capacity (which is 
unknown based on the question).</li>
<li>A, B. This is a case of having a recurring performance issue, which 
points to using schedule-based scaling. Further, you know that access is
 centered around the US East regions. C might help the issue, but 
without knowing more about the application, it’s not possible to tell if
 caching content would significantly improve performance.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_223"></span>C.
 Here, the determining factor is the requirement of instant access. S3 
One Zone-IA will give you that access, at a lower cost than S3 standard 
and S3-IA. According to AWS, all three classes have the same first byte 
latency (milliseconds).</li>
<li>D. Glacier takes 3–5 hours to deliver the first byte.</li>
<li>D. This is easy to miss, and often is. All three of these S3 storage classes share the same first-byte latency: milliseconds.</li>
<li>D. Spot instances offer you significant costs savings as long as you
 have flexibility and application processes can be stopped and started.</li>

<h2><a id="usec0003"></a>Domain 3: Specify Secure Applications and Architectures</h2>
<ol id="capp-list-0003">
<li>B, D. Option A is false, but option B is true. Default security 
groups prevent all traffic in and allow all traffic out. Options C and D
 are about whether or not a security group is stateful: whether an 
incoming connection automatically can get back out. Security groups <i>are</i> stateful, so D is true. If the subject of the question was a NACL, then option C would be true, as NACLs are stateless.</li>
<li>B. D is not a good answer because relying on encryption outside of 
S3 does not best address the concerns around consistency. It is 
generally better to allow AWS to handle encryption in cases where you 
want to ensure all encryption is the same across a data store. SSE-C, 
SSE-KMS, and SSE-C all provide this. However, among those three, KMS is 
the best option for providing clear audit trails.</li>
<li>A, C. A bastion host is a publicly accessible host that allows 
traffic to connect to it. Then, an additional connection is made from 
the bastion host into a private subnet and the hosts within that subnet.
 Because the bastion must be accessed by public clients, it must be 
exposed to the Internet (A). If it is within a private subnet (B), it 
will not be accessible, making that answer incorrect. There also must be
 an explicit route from the bastion host into the private subnet (C); 
this is usually within a NACL. Finally, the security of the bastion <i>must</i>
 be different from the hosts in the private subnet. The bastion host 
should be hardened significantly as it is public, but also accessible; 
this is in many ways the <i>opposite</i> of the security requirements of hosts within a private subnet.</li>
<li>A, C. AWS sometimes asks questions like this to ensure that you 
understand that the root account is truly a root account and you cannot 
restrict that account’s access. Anything that involves removing access 
for the root account is always invalid.</li>
<li>B. This is a “gimme question” that AWS will often ask on exams. You 
should never store your application keys on an instance, in an AMI, or 
anywhere else permanent on the cloud—meaning option B is true. 
Additionally, D makes no sense; application keys are for programmatic 
access, not console access.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_224"></span>A,
 C. Site-to-site VPN connections require a virtual private gateway (on 
the AWS side) and a customer gateway (on the local side). A private 
subnet is optional, but not required, as is a NAT instance.</li>
<li>B, D. There are two pairs of answers here, and you need to choose 
the correct pair in each case. For private subnet instances, you need a 
route out to a NAT gateway, and that NAT gateway must be in a public 
subnet—otherwise, it would not itself be able to provide outbound 
traffic access to the Internet. That means option D is correct, as is 
answer B: 0.0.0.0/0 means “traffic with a destination in the Internet at
 large,” more or less.</li>
<li>A, B. The easiest way to handle this question is by thinking of a 
NAT gateway as essentially a managed service and a NAT instance as an 
instance (which you manage) for networking. That helps identify B as 
false (you never choose instance types and sizes for managed services) 
and C as true (AWS patches managed services). Further, since AWS manages
 NAT gateways, they are automatically highly available and do not need 
you to associate security groups. This means that A is false—NAT 
instances <i>can be</i> made highly available, but not without your manual intervention—and D is true.</li>
<li>A. Option A is true, and if you know that, this is an easy question. However, it doesn’t seem obvious, as all custom NACLs <i>disallow</i>
 all inbound and outbound traffic. It is only a VPC’s default NACL that 
has an “allow all” policy. As for B and C, these are both reversed: 
NACLs are stateless (allowing independent configuration of inbound and 
outbound traffic) and security groups are stateful. This also explains 
why D is false: NACLs are stateless.</li>
<li>A. Permission changes to a role now take place immediately and apply to all instances using that role.</li>
<li>C. If an allow-everything doesn’t set off alarm bells, the reference
 to SSH should. Security groups, by default, don’t allow any traffic in.
 They require you to explicitly allow inbound traffic (C); the other 
options are all false. And security groups are stateful—remember this, 
as it will come up in almost every single exam.</li>
<li>C. All outbound traffic is allowed to pass out of a VPC by default, although no inbound traffic is allowed.</li>
<li>C. EBS volumes can be encrypted when they are created. All other 
options typically affect snapshots of the volume, but not the volume 
itself.</li>
<li>A, D. Security groups only contain allow rules, not deny rules (and 
prevent rules are not an actual rule type). Then, you can create both 
inbound and outbound rules.</li>
<li>B, C. You specify allow rules for security groups, so A is false. B 
and C are true: Default security groups allow all outbound traffic, and 
you specify separate inbound and outbound rules. Finally, security 
groups are stateful, not stateless, so D is false.</li>
<li>A, D. A is false, as security groups don’t provide for deny rules. B
 and C are both true (and therefore are not correct answers). D is 
false, because without specific outbound rules, nothing is allowed to 
flow out. (Note that by default, there is an allowance for all outgoing 
traffic in security groups, although that can be removed.)</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_225"></span>B,
 C. A security group can actually have no inbound or outbound rules, so A
 and D are not required. A security group does require a name and 
description, though.</li>
<li>B. A security group can be attached to multiple constructs, like an 
EC2 instance, but is ultimately associated with a network interface, 
which in turn is attached to individual instances. This is a tough 
question and probably at the very edge of what the exam might ask.</li>
<li>A, C. The easiest way to work this is to recognize that default 
security groups never allow broad inbound traffic. That eliminates B and
 D and leaves rules that allow all outbound traffic for both IPv4 (A) 
and IPv6 (C).</li>
<li>A, D. Security group rules have a protocol and a description. They 
do not have a subnet, although they can have CIDR blocks or single IP 
addresses. Instances can associate with a security group, but a security
 group does not itself refer to a specific instance.</li>
<li>B, C. They key here is not the endpoint, but the actual protocol 
used to access the endpoint. In this case, HTTPS is secure, while HTTP 
is not, so the answers using HTTPS—B and C—are correct.</li>
<li>A. Client-side encryption involves the client (you, in this example)
 managing the entire encryption and decryption process. AWS only 
provides storage.</li>
<li>C. With server-side encryption, AWS handles all the object encryption and decryption.</li>
<li>B, C. For client-side encryption, you’ll need a master key, which 
can either be a KMS-managed key (option B) or a client-side master key. 
You’ll also need an SDK for encrypting the client-side data (C).</li>
<li>C. You’ll probably simply need to memorize this one. SSE-S3, 
SSE-KMS, and SSE-C are all valid approaches to S3 encryption; SSE-E is 
made up.</li>
<li>B. The word <i>audit</i> should be a trigger for you: always choose 
KMS when you see a need for strong auditing. SSE-KMS provides a very 
good audit trail and security, perhaps the best of all these options for
 most use cases.</li>
<li>D. SSE-C allows the customer (the C in SSE-C) to manage keys, but S3 then handles the actual encryption of data.</li>
<li>C. Client-side encryption allows the customer to manage keys and 
encrypt data themselves, then store the data on S3 already encrypted. 
There’s a lot of overhead with this approach, but it’s ideal for the use
 case described.</li>
<li>A. In general, SSE-S3 is the “starter” option for encryption. It’s 
by no means a simple or amateur approach to security, but it is low cost
 compared to KMS and has much less overhead than client-side or SSE-C 
encryption keys.</li>
<li>A, C. Here, you must recognize that EU West and EU Central are both EU regions and the other two options are not.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_226"></span>B,
 C. Option A isn’t valid because US-West isn’t an EU region. Options B 
and C are valid as they both provide EU regions, and S3 and S3-IA both 
can survive the loss of an availability zone; option D would <i>not</i> survive the loss of an AZ.</li>
<li>B. Multi-AZ RDS instances use synchronous replication to push changes.</li>
<li>B. MFA Delete is the most powerful anti-deletion protection you can 
provide without disabling delete via IAM roles. Option A doesn’t affect 
your object storage—EBS is block storage. Options C and D both won’t 
help; delete requests can’t be blocked by Lambda, and there is no 
“DELETE endpoint” on the S3 API.</li>
<li>A, B. MFA Delete is the right option here (B), but A is a required 
step to enable MFA Delete. Option C doesn’t actually make sense, and 
while option D would technically prevent all deletions, it isn’t what 
the question is asking: You must prevent accidental deletions, not 
remove the ability to delete objects altogether.</li>
<li>D. You must enable versioning to enable MFA Delete. The region of 
the bucket doesn’t have any effect here (B and C), and there is no way 
to disable the REST API (A), although you could remove programmatic 
access via IAM or removal of access keys.</li>
<li>D. AWS Trusted Advisor does all three of the above: improve performance, reduce cost, and improve security.</li>
<li>D. AWS Trusted Advisor provides advice on cost, fault tolerance, 
performance, and security but does not address account organization.</li>
<li>A, B. Here, it’s not reasonable to memorize the seven core AWS 
Trusted Advisor checks. Instead, consider which of these are valid 
improvements that Trusted Advisor might make. A and B relate to security
 and permissions, while both C and D are pretty far afield of cost, 
security, or performance suggestions.</li>
<li>A, C. This is tricky. First, MFA on the root account is a standard 
recommendation, so you can select that. For the remaining three answers,
 the one that is most directly a “common security recommendation” would 
have to be S3 buckets with write access, and that is the correct answer.</li>
<li>B. The only one of these that’s not possible with IAM is denying the
 root account access to EC2 instances. That’s not possible—with IAM or 
any other mechanism.</li>
<li>B, C. A is true, and D is true; if you know this, choosing B and C 
is simple. Otherwise, you need to recognize that just supplying a client
 key to S3 is not enough; some form of client-side encryption or 
server-side encryption using client keys must be enabled. EBS volumes 
can be encrypted outside of S3 and stored regardless of how S3 is 
encrypting data.</li>
<li>A, B. There are four types of data encrypted when an EBS volume is 
encrypted: data at rest on the volume, data moving between the volume 
and the instance, any snapshots created from the volume, and any volumes
 created from those snapshots.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_227"></span>B,
 C. This is tricky, as both answers that involve unencrypted data have 
some tricky wording. First, B is not a case of encryption; if data never
 touches the encrypted volume, it is not automatically encrypted. 
Second, for C, data that is on the instance but never moves to the 
encrypted volume is also not automatically encrypted.</li>
<li>D. All of these are encrypted. Data moving to and from the volume as well as data at rest on the volume are all encrypted.</li>
<li>C. KMS is used as the encryption service, but this is not the S3-KMS
 that is specific to S3 encryption. You will also sometimes see this KMS
 referenced as AWS-KMS.</li>
<li>C. This is a case of pure memorization. The URL is always <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://169.254.169.254/">http://169.254.169.254</a></span> and the metadata, which is what you want, is at <span class="codeLabel">/latest/meta-data/</span>.</li>
<li>A, D. Encryption of a volume affects snapshots of the volume and instances created from that snapshot, but nothing else.</li>
<li>A, D. The only steps required here are to copy the snapshot to the 
new region (usually via the console), and then create a new volume from 
it.</li>
<li>D. You cannot encrypt a running instance; you have to create the instance with encryption enabled.</li>
<li>D. You cannot encrypt a running RDS instance, so B is incorrect, and
 you have no access to the underlying instance for RDS, so C is also 
incorrect. Option A sounds possible, but it will not address any data 
created by the database itself (such as indices, references to other 
data in the database, etc.). The only way to encrypt an RDS instance is 
to encrypt it at creation of the instance.</li>
<li>C. The only option here is the manual one. You must set up 
encryption when creating a new instance from scratch (snapshots won’t 
work) and then move data into it so that this data is encrypted as it 
moves into the new instance.</li>
<li>A. You cannot encrypt an existing volume “on the fly.” You must 
create a snapshot and then encrypt that snapshot as you copy it to 
another, encrypted snapshot. You can then restore from that new 
snapshot.</li>
<li>D. None of these will work. The important thing to remember for a question like this is that you must make a <i>copy</i> of an unencrypted snapshot to apply encryption. There is no in-place encryption mechanism for volumes or snapshots.</li>
<li>B. The only way to encrypt an EBS volume is to encrypt it <i>at creation time</i>. Remembering this one detail will help on lots of questions in this vein.</li>
<li>C, D. You cannot encrypt an existing EBS volume, so A is incorrect. 
And you cannot encrypt a snapshot that is unencrypted, so B is 
incorrect. You <i>can</i> encrypt a copy of a snapshot and restore an encrypted snapshot to a volume that is encrypted (C and D).</li>
<li>B, C. Snapshots of encrypted volumes stay encrypted—whether you copy
 them (B and C) or create volumes from them (D). So A and D are true, 
while B and C are false.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_228"></span>B.
 You can copy snapshots across accounts, but the default permissions do 
not allow this. So you have to modify those permissions, and then the 
snapshot can be copied to any other AWS account, regardless of account 
owner.</li>
<li>B. You can only create volumes from snapshots in the same region. 
Since the instance is desired in US West 1, a copy of the snapshot must 
be made in that region first, so B is correct.</li>
<li>C. You can copy a snapshot to a different region without any special considerations.</li>
<li>A, C. Security groups control the inbound and outbound traffic allowed into and out of instances.</li>
<li>C. An instance must have a security group but can have more than that.</li>
<li>A. In addition to security groups, NACLs (network access control 
lists) can be used to further refine inbound and outbound routing into 
and out of a VPC. Security groups are attached to instances, and NACLs 
to VPCs, building a complete security picture of your VPC and its 
instances.</li>
<li>C. NACLs are virtual firewalls, and they operate at the subnet and 
VPC level rather than at an individual instance level. Also note the 
words <i>custom, user-created</i>. The default NACL does allow in and out all traffic; created NACLs do not.</li>
<li>D. IAM roles and permissions control access to NACLs.</li>
<li>B, C. Security groups support only allow rules (A is false). They do
 evaluate all rules (B is true) and operate at the instance level (C is 
true). D is false, as security groups aren’t associated with a subnet.</li>
<li>A, D. Security groups are stateful and are associated with an 
instance (or instances), so A and D are true. They are not stateless, 
and they process all rules rather than processing rules in order.</li>
<li>B, C. NACLs are stateless; rules must be specified for traffic going
 both in and out (so A is false, and B is true). They also process rules
 in order (C is true). They’re associated with subnets, not a particular
 instance (so D is false).</li>
<li>A, C. NACLs are associated with a subnet (A) and support both allow 
and deny rules (C). B is false; NACLs and security groups work together.
 D is false, as rules are processed in order.</li>
<li>B. NACLs are always evaluated first because they exist at the border
 of a subnet. As security groups are attached to instances, they are not
 processed until traffic passes through the NACL and into the instance’s
 subnet.</li>
<li>A, B. Both security groups and NACLs can—and usually do—apply to 
multiple instances in a subnet. The NACL applies to all instances within
 the associate subnet, and a security group can be associated with 
multiple instances.</li>
<li>B. NACLs are associated with subnets.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_229"></span>A, B. The default NACL allows in and out all traffic, which is somewhat unintuitive. Keep in mind that the default <i>security group</i> disallows inbound traffic, but the default NACL allows that traffic in.</li>
<li>C, D. Unlike the default NACL that comes with the default VPC, 
custom NACLs disallow all inbound and outbound traffic by default.</li>
<li>A. Each rule in a NACL has a number, and those rules are evaluated using those numbers, moving from low to high.</li>
<li>B, D. A and C are true. B is false; NACLs are stateless. D is false, because a NACL can be associated with multiple subnets.</li>
<li>B. A NACL is associated with a subnet, not an instance or VPC. It can be associated with a single subnet or multiple subnets.</li>
<li>A. A subnet is associated with a NACL. However, a subnet can only be associated to a single NACL at a time.</li>
<li>D. A subnet is associated with a NACL but can only be associated to a single NACL at a time.</li>
<li>B, D. NACL rules have a rule number, a protocol, a choice of ALLOW 
or DENY, and a CIDR range and port or port range for inbound and 
outbound traffic.</li>
<li>A, B. NACL rules have a rule number, a protocol, a choice of ALLOW 
or DENY, and a CIDR range and port or port range for inbound and 
outbound traffic.</li>
<li>B. Almost none of this detail actually matters. The only key 
parameter is the rule number. NACLs evaluate lowest-numbered rules 
first, so Rule #100 would go first, option B.</li>
<li>D. SSH is not explicitly mentioned, so it is not allowed on a custom NACL. Every protocol must explicitly be mentioned.</li>
<li>A. SSH is not explicitly mentioned, but because the question asks about the <i>default</i> NACL on the <i>default</i> VPC, all traffic is allowed in unless explicitly denied.</li>
<li>B. SSH is allowed here, but only from a specific CIDR block.</li>
<li>D. While there is a rule allowing SSH from the CIDR block 
192.0.2.0/24, that rule would be evaluated after the lower-numbered rule
 110, which disallows any traffic not allowed in from lower-numbered 
rules (in this case, just rule #100).</li>
<li>D. Technically, B and C are correct; SSH is a type of TCP traffic. 
However, that is not the most specific answer, which is what the 
question asks. A is partially correct but does not call out the CIDR 
block limitation that D does. Therefore, D is the most accurate answer.</li>
<li>B. The <i>most accurate</i> answer here includes several components:
 the type of TCP traffic (HTTP), the allowed source CIDR block (the 
entire Internet), and IPv4. This rule does <i>not</i> explicitly allow 
IPv6 traffic. Further, this rule is only effective if there are no 
lower-numbered rules that short-circuit this rule.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_230"></span>B.
 0.0.0.0/0 represents IPv4 addresses, and the entire Internet. However, a
 CIDR block does not represent any type of traffic, inbound or outbound.</li>
<li>C. ::/0 represents IPv6 addresses, and the entire Internet. However,
 a CIDR block does not represent any type of traffic, inbound or 
outbound.</li>
<li>B. ::/0 represents IPv6 addresses, so the answer must be either B or
 D. The route should go from all IPv6 addresses to the ID of the NAT 
gateway, which is nat-123456789. There is no intermediate -&gt; NAT that
 should be inserted into the routes.</li>
<li>D. A VPC spans all the availability zones in a region.</li>
<li>B, C. You must always select a region to create a VPC, and you must 
always provide a CIDR block. VPCs span all the AZs in a region, so that 
is not required, and security groups are associated at the instance 
level rather than at the VPC level.</li>
<li>C. For a single VPC, you can add one or more subnets to each availability zone within that VPC.</li>
<li>B. A subnet cannot span availability zones. It can be added to a single AZ.</li>
<li>B. A subnet cannot span availability zones. It can be added to a single AZ and can only exist within that single AZ.</li>
<li>B. A VPC can have a single primary CIDR block assigned to it for 
IPv4 addresses and an optional IPv6 CIDR block. While you can add 
secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks, you <i>cannot</i> add additional CIDR blocks for IPv6 at this time.</li>
<li>C. A VPC can have a single primary CIDR block assigned to it for 
IPv4 addresses and an optional IPv6 CIDR block. However, you can add <i>additional</i> secondary CIDR blocks to a VPC (up to four).</li>
<li>D. Any subnet that routes traffic through an internet gateway is a public subnet by definition.</li>
<li>B. Instances in a public subnet are not automatically reachable. 
They must have either a public IPv4 or IPv6 address (B) or an elastic IP
 address.</li>
<li>D. A public subnet, as well as existing Internet-accessible 
instances, indicates a working internet gateway, so C is not correct. A 
is not an actual AWS option, and B—Auto Scaling—would not address public
 accessibility. This leaves D, which is correct: Instances in a public 
subnet that are intended to be Internet accessible need either a public 
IP address or an elastic IP address assigned to the instance.</li>
<li>A, C. When creating a VPC, you can specify an option name, a required IPv4 CIDR block, and an optional IPv6 CIDR block.</li>
<li>A, C. When creating a VPC, you can specify an option name, a 
required IPv4 CIDR block, and an optional IPv6 CIDR block. You cannot 
assign tags to a VPC at creation time.</li>
<li>B, D. A public subnet is one in which traffic is routed (via a routing table, B) to an internet gateway (D).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_231"></span>B, C. A VPN-only subnet routes traffic through a virtual private gateway rather than an internet gateway.</li>
<li>A, B. At a minimum, a VPC-only subnet must have a routing table 
routing traffic and a virtual private gateway to which traffic is 
routed. Neither elastic IP addresses nor internet gateways are required.</li>
<li>B. You can only create 5 VPCs per region by default. Creating more requires a request to&nbsp;AWS.</li>
<li>D. This is a high number, but accurate: You can create 200 subnets per VPC.</li>
<li>B. This is a very hard question, but it can come up, albeit rarely. 
This limit is your primary CIDR block and then, in addition, 4 secondary
 CIDR blocks.</li>
<li>B. You’re allowed 5 elastic IP addresses per region, unless you have the default limits raised by AWS.</li>
<li>B, D. Subnets must have CIDR blocks (so D is false), and the block 
must be the same as or smaller than the CIDR block for the VPC within 
which it exists, so while A and C are true, B is false.</li>
<li>C. A VPC peering connection connects one VPC to another VPC via networking and routing.</li>
<li>C. A VPC VPN connection links your on-site network to a VPC within the AWS cloud.</li>
<li>A, C. A VPC VPN connection requires a customer gateway, a VPN connection, and a virtual private gateway.</li>
<li>B, D. Customer gateways (A) and virtual private gateways (C) are 
used in VPN connections. For security, a NACL (B) is used at the subnet 
level, and a security group (D) can be used at the instance level.</li>
<li>B. A NACL is best for dealing with all traffic at a subnet or VPC level, as it is associated at the subnet level.</li>
<li>D. Anytime you are protecting or limiting traffic to or from 
specific instances, a security group is your best choice. Security 
groups are associated with specific instances, so they can effectively 
limit traffic to some instances while allowing other instances—using 
different security groups—to still be accessible.</li>
<li>A, C. This takes a little careful reading. First, it is not 
considered a good practice to mix private and public instances within a 
subnet—although this is not a hard-and-fast rule. So C, moving the 
private database instances into a different subnet, is at least worth 
considering. D is not helpful in this case. If you have two subnets, one
 private and one public, then A is a good idea: NACLs can protect one 
subnet and keep another public. Finally, B is <i>not</i> valid, because of the word <i>single</i>.
 You cannot have a single security group that allows traffic to one 
instance but not to another. This leaves A and C as the best combined 
solution.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_232"></span>C.
 A security group denies all traffic unless explicitly allowed. This 
means it functions as a whitelist: Only specific rules allow in traffic,
 and all other traffic is denied.</li>
<li>C, D. A security group operates at the instance level, and a NACL operates at the subnet level.</li>
<li>A. A security group performs stateful filtering, meaning that 
traffic allowed in is automatically allowed back out, without the need 
for an explicit outbound rule.</li>
<li>D. Network ACLs are stateless. Inbound traffic is not automatically 
allowed back out; an explicit rule must be present for traffic to move 
from within a subnet back out of that subnet.</li>
<li>D. VPC peering allows a VPC to connect with any other VPC: in the 
same region, in a different region, or in a different account 
altogether.</li>
<li>B, D. VPC peering allows a VPC to connect with any other VPC, so the options that don’t involve VPCs are incorrect: B and D.</li>
<li>B, D. As long as there is a gateway (internet or virtual private) on
 the source VPC, and routing through that gateway, an instance in a VPC 
can communicate with other instances. So in this case, you’d want B and 
D. There is no “cross-VPC communication” option, and security groups 
won’t actually help this scenario.</li>
<li>A, D. This is a little difficult, but it comes down to 
accessibility: How can the target instance be reached? Of the answers 
available, a public IP would make the target available, as would a VPN 
connection.</li>
<li>D. VPCs are fundamental to AWS networking and are available in all AWS regions.</li>
<li>D. A VPC automatically spans all the availability zones within the region in which it exists.</li>
<li>B. When you launch an instance, you must specify an availability 
zone. This could be as simple as accepting the AWS default, but it is 
your choice.</li>
<li>B. EBS volumes can be encrypted, but it must be done at launch time (B).</li>
<li>D. A VPC endpoint is a connection to an AWS service and explicitly does <i>not</i> use internet gateways, VPN connections, or NAT devices.</li>
<li>B. A VPC endpoint is a virtual device, not a physical one.</li>
<li>C. A VPC endpoint is for attaching to AWS services and explicitly does <i>not</i> require an internet gateway (C).</li>
<li>C. By default, IAM users don’t have permissions to work with endpoints. You may need to create an IAM role. You would <i>not</i> need a NAT device (A or B) or a security group (D) to use a VPC endpoint.</li>
<li>B. A private subnet is not accessible without a bastion host or 
other connection and routing from the public Internet to an accessible 
host and finally into private instances.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_233"></span>B.
 Bastion hosts should be in a public subnet so that they can be accessed
 via the public Internet. They can then route traffic into a private 
subnet.</li>
<li>C. Bastion hosts are also sometimes called jump servers, because 
they allow a connection to “jump” to the bastion and then into a private
 subnet.</li>
<li>D. Bastion hosts are intended to provide access to private instances
 in private subnets; in other words, instances inaccessible via the 
public Internet in any other way.</li>
<li>D. Bastion hosts are publicly accessible and have access to your private hosts. Therefore, they must be the <i>most</i>
 secure hosts on your network. Use a network ACL for the subnet in which
 it resides, a security group for the instance, and OS hardening to 
reduce access within the instance itself.</li>
<li>B. Shell access only requires SSH, and you should therefore only allow that protocol. Always allow <i>only what is absolutely required</i> for bastion hosts.</li>
<li>D. Internet gateways scale horizontally, not vertically. They are also redundant and highly available automatically.</li>
<li>C. Internet gateways attach to VPCs and serve multiple subnets (if needed).</li>
<li>B. The route 0.0.0.0/0 catches all IPv4 traffic intended for the 
public Internet. ::/0 is for IPv6, 0.0.0.0/24 limits traffic to a 
certain CIDR block, and D is an internal IP address.</li>
<li>C. The route ::/0 catches all IPv6 traffic intended for the public 
Internet. 0.0.0.0/0 is for IPv6, 0.0.0.0/24 limits traffic to a certain 
CIDR block, and D is an internal IP address.</li>
<li>D. An instance must have IPv6 communication from itself (with a 
public IP address) through a subnet with IPv6 addresses, in a VPC with 
IPv6 addresses, to reach the Internet via IPv6. A virtual private 
gateway is not connected with any of these.</li>
<li>A, B. For an instance to reach and be reached to and from the public
 Internet, the instance must have either a public IP address or an 
elastic IP address associated with it. IAM roles do not provide public 
access, and NACLs are attached to subnets, not instances.</li>
<li>A, C. A public subnet, by definition, is a subnet with an internet 
gateway attached. And the default VPC has an internet gateway 
automatically attached.</li>
<li>B. ALB stands for application load balancer.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_234"></span>B.
 Application load balancers operate at the Application layer, which is 
layer 7 of the OSI model. ELBs (classic load balancers) operate at the 
Transport layer, layer 4, as well as layer 7, and network load balancers
 operate at layer 4 as well.</li>
<li>A. Application load balancers operate at the Application layer, 
which is layer 7 of the OSI model. ELBs (classic load balancers) operate
 at the Transport layer, layer 4, as well as layer 7, and network load 
balancers operate at layer 4 as well.</li>
<li>C. Application load balancers operate at the Application layer, 
which is layer 7 of the OSI model. ELBs (classic load balancers) operate
 at the Transport layer, layer 4, as well as layer 7, and network load 
balancers operate at Level 4 as well.</li>
<li>D. Both network and classic load balancers operate at the Transport 
layer. Classic load balancers also operate at layer 7, the Application 
layer. Application load balancers operate at the Application layer, 
which is layer 7 of the OSI model.</li>
<li>D. Both classic and application load balancers operate at the 
Application layer. Classic load balancers also operate at layer 4, the 
Transport layer. Network load balancers operate at the Transport layer, 
which is layer 4 of the OSI model.</li>
<li>C. By default, subnets in the default VPC are public. The default 
VPC has an internet gateway attached and the default subnets are public 
as a result.</li>
<li>A. By default, subnets in custom VPCs are private. Other than the 
default VPC, custom VPCs don’t have internet gateways attached by 
default, and created subnets don’t have public access.</li>
<li>C. Instances launched into non-default subnets have a private IPv4 
address, but not a public one, so C is correct. All instances have a 
security group created or associated, and instances can always talk to 
other instances in the subnet by default.</li>
<li>C, D. Instances launched into non-default subnets have a private 
IPv4 address, but not a public one, so they need an elastic IP address, 
as answer C indicates. (A public IP address would work as well.) You’d 
also need an internet gateway for the instance (D).</li>
<li>D. Instances launched into default subnets in the default VPC can 
automatically reach out to the public Internet, as that VPC has an 
internet gateway and instances get a public IPv4 address.</li>
<li>A. A NAT device—network address translation—provides routing for 
instances to an internet gateway but can prevent undesired inbound 
traffic.</li>
<li>D. A NAT device provides access to the Internet from private instances—they allow outgoing traffic rather than incoming traffic.</li>
<li>B, C. AWS offers two NAT devices: a NAT instance and a NAT gateway.</li>
<li>A, D. Instances always require an AMI. In this question, the two instances are EC2 instances (A) and NAT instances (D).</li>
<li>B. A NAT gateway is an entirely managed device from AWS. All the 
other options require maintenance by the user of OS-level patches and 
updates.</li>
<li>B. A NAT instance does not provide automatic scaling, whereas 
DynamoDB and NAT gateways are managed services and do. There is really 
no such thing as “scaling” of an SNS topic, although SNS as a service 
does do some scaling in the background to ensure that demand is met.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_235"></span>A.
 Of these options, only bastion hosts and NAT instances are unmanaged 
services, making them the only two possible answers. A bastion host 
typically has SSH routing and permissions to private instances, making 
it the most important to properly secure. While a NAT instance is 
usually available to private instances, traffic flows out from the NAT 
instance and not into the private instances.</li>
<li>D. A NAT instance is a candidate for a bastion server. The other options are all managed services.</li>
<li>C, D. A site-to-site VPN connection requires a virtual private 
gateway on the VPC side (C) and a customer gateway on the on-site side 
(D).</li>
<li>A, C. A site-to-site connection is going to require a private subnet
 on the AWS side (C), with private instances within it. Further, you’ll 
need a NAT instance (A) or similar device to route traffic and receive 
traffic as a static IP holder.</li>
<li>B. An egress-only gateway is for use with IPv6 traffic only.</li>
<li>C. An egress-only gateway is for use with IPv6 traffic and only 
allows outbound traffic. A VPC endpoint connects to managed AWS 
services, and an internet gateway (that isn’t egress only) allows both 
inbound and outbound traffic. A NAT gateway is for allowing outbound 
traffic from a private subnet rather than a public subnet.</li>
<li>A, C. A NAT instance must be in a public subnet so that it is 
accessible from the Internet. It also must have access to private 
instances in private subnets in your VPC.</li>
<li>B, C. Egress-only internet gateways are stateful and support IPv6 
traffic. This is a matter of memorization, although you can somewhat 
reason that the gateway—absent a NACL—allows responses to come back to 
instances that use it to communicate with the public Internet.</li>
<li>C. The most important thing here is to remember that egress-only 
internet gateways only work with IPv6 addresses. This eliminates A and 
B. Then, only C addresses the entire public Internet in an IPv6 format.</li>
<li>A, D. IPv6 addresses are public by default (D) <i>because</i> they are globally unique. There is no need to have private IPv6 addresses because the range is so large.</li>
<li>B, C. An elastic network interface is virtual and can have multiple 
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as well as security groups, a MAC address, and a
 source/destination check flag.</li>
<li>D. An elastic network interface is virtual and can have multiple 
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as well as security groups, a MAC address, and a
 source/destination check flag. NACLs apply to subnets, though, not 
network interfaces on instances.</li>
<li>C. An instance has a primary network interface in all cases but can 
have additional network interfaces attached, so the answer is C, one or 
more.</li>
<li>A. Traffic follows the network interface rather than sticking to any
 particular instance. So in this case, traffic is redirected to the new 
instance but stays targeted at the elastic network interface (A).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_236"></span>C.
 An elastic network interface can only be attached to a single instance 
at one time but can be moved from one instance to another.</li>
<li>B. You actually can’t increase network throughput with multiple 
interfaces, making B false. All three other options are legitimate 
reasons to attach multiple interfaces to an instance.</li>
<li>C. An instance’s primary network interface cannot be detached (C), 
making that the correct answer. You can detach secondary interfaces (A),
 attach multiple interfaces (B), and move network interfaces (D).</li>
<li>D. Elastic network interfaces do not have routing tables, but they 
do have (or can have) IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and a source/destination 
check flag.</li>
<li>C. Elastic IP addresses are specifically for avoiding being tied to a
 specific instance, so A and B are not correct. Security groups are 
typically not associated with a specific IP address (D). This leaves C, a
 valid reason for an elastic IP address: It can move from one instance 
(if the instance fails) to another.</li>
<li>A. Elastic IP addresses are, by definition, an IP address that will 
not change, so A is correct—you cannot change the IP address while it is
 in use. You can move elastic IPs (B), including across VPCs (C), and 
you absolutely would associate it with a single instance (D).</li>
<li>B, C. An elastic IP can mask the failure of an instance (B) by 
moving traffic to another running instance transparently. It also allows
 all the network interface attributes to be moved at one time (C).</li>
<li>A, D. To use an elastic IP, you must first allocate it for use in a 
VPC and then associate it with an instance in that VPC (A and D). Route 
53 is not involved at this stage, and you cannot detach the primary 
network interface on an instance.</li>
<li>D. There is not such thing as an “EBS management tool” separate from the AWS API, CLI, and console.</li>
<li>C. Although instances exist in a region and VPC, and can be part of 
an Auto Scaling group, they are provisioned into specific availability 
zones (C).</li>
<li>A. EBS snapshots are backed up to S3 incrementally.</li>
<li>A. Changes to IAM roles take place immediately.</li>
<li>A. You can only assign a single role to an instance.</li>
<li>B, D. You can only assign a single role to an instance (D), but you 
can also create a new role that combines the desired policies (B).</li>
<li>A, D. You always need to make the actual role changes (A). There are
 then no more actions required for these changes to take effect on the 
instances.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_237"></span>B,
 D. You’ll first need to create an IAM role with the desired permissions
 (B). Then, you can attach the role to a running instance to avoid 
downtime completely (D). Note that this is relatively new; older 
versions of AWS required restarting the instance.</li>
<li>A. If a snapshot is the root device of a registered AMI, it cannot be deleted.</li>
<li>A. Encryption can only be applied to EBS volumes at creation time, so A is correct.</li>
<li>B. By default, root volumes do get deleted when the associated 
instance terminates. However, you can configure this to not be the case 
using the AWS console or CLI (B).</li>
<li>C. Using defaults is not part of the well-architected framework, and it often is not the most secure approach.</li>

<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_238"></span>A,
 C. All of these options are valid, but only two should be done for all 
environments: enabling MFA on the root account and setting a password 
rotation policy. Enabling MFA Delete on S3 is a good idea but may not 
apply to all situations. Further, not all users may need an IAM role; 
some, for example, are fine with the default roles.</li>
<li>C. AWS infrastructure operates at the VPC layer and is almost entirely virtual.</li>
<li>A, C. CloudWatch and CloudTrail both provide monitoring and logging,
 both of which can identify security breaches. CloudFormation is a

<li>D. MFA is Multi-Factor Authentication, which adds a layer of protection related to privilege management.</li>

operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, 
and cost optimization. Organizational issues are considered outside of

<li>D. While A and C are both good ideas, they are more specific than 
the well-architected framework’s principles. B is a part of a principle,
 but data should be protected at rest and in transit. This leaves D, and
 people should be kept away from direct access to data. Instead, tools 
and APIs should provide a layer between users and data.</li>
<li>A, D. The five areas are Identity and Access Management (A), 
detective controls, infrastructure protection, data protection, and 
incident response (D).</li>
<li>A. AWS takes responsibility for physically securing cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>A, C. The root account is the first account in every account (A), 
but it should only be used for creating other users and groups (C). It 
is <i>not</i> intended for everyday tasks (B), and once account setup is complete, you are encouraged by AWS to delete any access keys (D).</li>
<li>C, D. A good password policy has minimum length and complexity requirements.</li>
<li>C. Users with console access are more privileged users and should be
 required to use MFA (C). Password policies apply to all users, so A is 
incorrect. Further, passwords are the mechanism for logging into the 
console, so B is wrong in that access keys are not used for console 
login.</li>

allowed to do what they have to in order to perform their job functions.</li>
<li>B. AWS Organizations groups accounts into organizational units (OUs), allowing for groupings of permissions and roles.</li>
<li>A. An SCP in AWS Organizations is a service control policy and can 
be applied to an organizational unit (OU) to affect all users within 
that OU. It effectively applies permissions at an organizational level, 
much the way that a group applies them at a user level.</li>
<li>C. Service control policies (SCPs) are applied to OUs (organizational units) in AWS Organizations.</li>
<li>A. Service control policies (SCPs) provide for working across AWS 
accounts (A). Organizational units (OUs) are groupings of accounts, and 
IAM roles are applied to users and groups, not cross-account structures.</li>
<li>C. AWS Organizations offers a means of organizing and managing policies that span AWS accounts.</li>
<li>D. AWS provides all of the above options as a means of providing security of the AWS environment.</li>
<li>B. SSE-S3 offers encryption at rest while deferring key management 
to AWS. SSE-KMS does the same but has a higher cost and is more suitable
 for stringent auditing. The other two options involve work on the 
client side, which the question states is undesirable.</li>
<li>C. SSE-KMS is the best solution for any encryption problem that requires a strong audit trail.</li>
<li>C. New users should be given a new IAM user, and when permissions 
are the same across users, a group should be used instead of 
individually assigning permissions.</li>
<li>B. Most of these answers are overly complicated. S3 is highly 
available by default, so simply setting up a bucket in an EU region is 
sufficient.</li>
<li>D. All S3 storage classes provide SSL for data at transit as well as encryption of data at rest.</li>

<li>A. The shared responsibility model defines the portions of the cloud
 that AWS secures, and the portions that you, the AWS customer, must 
secure.</li>
<li>B. This is pretty tough unless you’ve read the AWS shared 
responsibility white papers and FAQs. It’s really a matter of 
memorization and knowing that while AWS uses the term <i>managed services</i> in lots of areas, that term is <i>not</i> used in the shared responsibility model as one of the core types of services.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_240"></span>C.
 AWS is responsible for the security of virtualization infrastructure. 
All other items in this list are your responsibility. As a hint on 
questions like this and related to the AWS shared responsibility model, 
AWS is typically responsible for anything with the word <i>infrastructure</i>, although there are some exclusions (for example, <i>application infrastructure</i>).</li>
<li>A. An IAM role is assumed by an EC2 instance when it needs to access
 other AWS services, and that role has permissions associated with it. 
While these permissions are formally defined in a policy (B), it is the 
role that is used by the instance for actual service access.</li>
<li>A, D. Just as is the case with a compute instance (EC2), a task in a
 container needs an IAM role with permissions to access S3 (A), which in
 turn requires a policy specifying a permission that lets ECS tasks 
access S3 (D). Both of these are required to ensure access. Security 
groups apply to network traffic and would not affect S3 access, and 
while a VPC endpoint could be used (C), it is not required.</li>
<li>C. By default, newly created S3 buckets are private. They can only be accessed by a user that has been granted explicit access.</li>

<h2><a id="usec0004"></a>Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures</h2>
<ol id="capp-list-0004">
<li>A, B. When instance cost is the issue, the answers are almost always
 to consider some form of lowered instance pricing. AWS provides 
reserved instances and spot instances and the spot market for this 
purpose. Further, paying for reserved instances all up front is the most
 cost-effective means of getting reserved instances. Therefore, A and B 
are correct. C is problematic, as running a smaller instance for longer 
is not necessarily any cheaper than running a large instance for shorter
 amounts of time. Option D has some validity, but AWS is almost 
certainly going to point you back to either reserved instances or the 
spot market (A and B).</li>
<li>C, D. Reserved instances can be paid for in no up-front, partial 
up-front, and all up-front models, where all up-front is the least 
expensive and no up-front is the most expensive.</li>
<li>D. Reserved instances are locked to the region in which they are 
created, so D is correct. You would need to create a new reserved 
instance in the new region.</li>
<li>C. This should be an easy correct answer: Spot instances via the 
spot market are the potentially least expensive option, given that your 
compute has flexible timing and needs.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_241"></span>B,
 C. Applications with spiky workloads are reasons to use on-demand, as 
on-demand can scale up and down quickly. Flexible start and end times is
 a criterion for choosing spot instances, and steady-state usage is 
ideal for reserved instances. Anytime you’re testing a new application, 
on-demand is a good choice</li>
<li>B, D. Applications with spiky workloads are reasons to use 
on-demand, as on-demand can scale up and down quickly. Flexible start 
and end times is a criterion for choosing spot instances, and 
steady-state usage is ideal for reserved instances. Spot instances also 
make heavy compute affordable when it would not be on other instance 
types.</li>
<li>C, D. The first option is easy, as it actually has <i>reserved</i> 
in the wording. Steady-state usage is also a use case for reserved 
instances, to gain cost savings. Large and immediate additional capacity
 needs are best facilitated by spot instances, and on-demand instances 
are best for users with no initial payment ability.</li>
<li>A, B. S3 shares the durability of all S3 storage classes at 11 9s. 
It also provides the highest availability throughput of all S3 storage 
classes. Infrequent access is a use case for S3-IA, while the ability to
 re-create objects would suggest S3 One Zone-IA.</li>
<li>A, D. The problem here is that instances are scaling down too 
quickly. This results in them then being restarted, which incurs cost. 
The solutions here should be ones that cause instances to stay around a 
bit longer, which meets demand. Both A and D do this. Cool-down timers 
increase the time for the group to ensure that previous scaling actions 
were completed (A), and the CloudWatch alarm period for scaling down 
should also be increased (D).</li>
<li>D. This is a pretty “by the book” question, and in this case, is the
 exact use case for which S3-IA (Infrequent Access) was built. Instant 
access with less frequent requests is ideal for S3-IA.</li>
<li>A. S3-IA is less expensive than S3, regardless of use case. It is certainly possible that S3-IA is not <i>appropriate</i> for a certain use case, but it is less expensive on a “per byte retrieved” case.</li>
<li>C. CloudFront will allow you to cache files that are frequently 
accessed. In this case, that should actually reduce costs. While 
CloudFront does incur a new additional cost, it would likely be offset 
by reduced egress from the EFS as well as the compute of additional EC2 
instances to handle requests.</li>
<li>D. All the description here suggests using Glacier. The documents 
are a large archive, and many will never be accessed. However, the 
requirement for quick retrieval points to a need for expedited 
retrieval. Glacier with expedited retrieval is still going to cost less 
than S3-IA for access that isn’t that frequent.</li>
<li>B. First, EBS is a much better choice than EFS for a single-instance
 application. While a database would certainly benefit from IOPS, 
there’s no need; peaks are small, and usage overall is low. A General 
Purpose SSD is sufficient here.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_242"></span>C. If you have a larger database workload, provisioned IOPS SSD is ideal.</li>
<li>D. A cold HDD is the least expensive EBS volume type.</li>
<li>A. This is a tough question. You can eliminate B and C because both 
involve additional services: CloudWatch, Lambda, and additional EC2 
instances. Taking EBS snapshots is good, and by moving those snapshots 
into S3 (which is the default), you get durability automatically. 
Mirroring data is also a great option—providing fault tolerance—but this
 does not provide a durability component, something the question 
specifically requires. Therefore, A is the best answer.</li>
<li>B. There are two components to this question: which storage medium 
is appropriate, and how should older records be deleted. To get both 
immediate retrieval and lifecycle management, you’d need S3, as in 
option B. (Also, EBS does not offer lifecycle management, in option D.)</li>
<li>A, C. RDS read replicas would take some of the read load off of the 
database instance, as would ElastiCache. The first allows reads to go to
 other instances, and the second caches already accessed data.</li>
<li>B, D. Glacier is the easy choice, as it can handle the oldest data 
and still meet the 10-hour retrieval time. S3 RRS is deprecated and 
shouldn’t be considered. This leaves S3 and S3-IA. S3-IA is always less 
expensive than S3, so it’s the better option here.</li>
<li>B. Placement groups are typically in a single availability zone, but
 now spread placement groups can be placed across availability zones.</li>
<li>B. It is typical to think of a spread placement group as a group spread across availability zones, but that is a misnomer. The <i>spread</i> in spread placement group means that the instances are spread across distinct underlying hardware, and although they <i>can</i> be spread across availability zones, they don’t have to be.</li>
<li>C. A spread placement group can have a maximum of seven running instances per AZ.</li>
<li>A, C. Spread placement groups primarily offer reduced network lag 
between instances (C). They also allow for cross-VPC spanning of 
instances (A).</li>
<li>C. The only false statement here is C: Spread placement groups 
cannot be set up across regions, and therefore this entire statement is 
untrue.</li>
<li>B, C. Egress always has a cost associated with it (B), while ingress
 is always free. Transferring data across regions is treated the same as
 transfers to the Internet. Only inter-AZ data transfer is guaranteed to
 be costless (D), making C the other correct answer.</li>
<li>C. The least cost is always going to be “free,” so look for anything
 that might be ingress. In this cost, uploading to S3 is straight 
ingress and is therefore free and the cheapest option.</li>
<li>B. There are no ingress options here, so nothing is guaranteed to be
 free. In that case, you should then look for something that moves data 
within the same availability zone. That’s always the least expensive 
(and usually free, depending on IP addresses), and in this case, that’s 
option B: inter-AZ data transfer between instances.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_243"></span>A,
 B. First, CloudFront is always a good option. It’s free to move data 
from EC2 to CloudFront, so that could reduce how far data must travel, 
and associated costs. Then, private IPs allow for communication that 
doesn’t route out to the Internet, and generally AWS charges less for 
communication from private IP to private IP.</li>
<li>B. Although there is a free tier, it’s a billing option and not an 
actual support level. That makes B the non-level in this answer set.</li>
<li>C. AWS reduces the need for large capital expenditures and provides a pay-as-you-go model instead.</li>
<li>B. AWS uses a pay-as-you-go model for all of its services.</li>
<li>D. D is incorrect; you actually pay even less as AWS grows, due to economies of scale.</li>
<li>C. “Migration only” is not a pricing model for instances. The only model not mentioned here is dedicated hosts.</li>
<li>B. AWS suggests using reserved instance pricing in TCO calculations,
 as it is closest to on-premises servers in an apples-to-apples 
comparison.</li>
<li>A. Standard reserved instances often provide up to a 75% discount as compared to on-demand instances.</li>
<li>C. There is no “half upfront” payment option. The valid options are no upfront, partial upfront, and all upfront.</li>
<li>C. Paying all upfront is the cheapest option of these three and provides the greatest savings over on-demand pricing.</li>
<li>B, D. Reserved instances can be purchased for either one- or three-year terms.</li>
<li>A, C. A spot instance (A) is a valid model, but spot market (B) is 
not; spot market is where you purchase spot instances. Dedicated hosts 
(C) is another valid model. All upfront is a payment option, but not an 
actual pricing model for instances.</li>
<li>A. Spot instances are recommended for applications with flexible 
start and end times, that need to run with low compute prices, or that 
may have urgent compute needs for large amounts of additional capacity.</li>
<li>B. On-demand instances are best when usage patterns swing severely and can’t be predicted.</li>
<li>B. On-demand instances are ideal for any usage that swings wildly in
 unpredictable patterns, particularly if a job cannot be halted. If 
usage is predictable, a long-running job might benefit from a reserved 
instance, and if the job can be stopped, then spot instances would be 
better.</li>
<li>A, D. This is a little tricky, as dedicated hosts function a bit 
differently than the other instance types, in both purchasing and 
payment. In this case, it’s important to note that the question is about
 purchasing, and <i>not</i> payment (which would drive you to answer 
“all upfront,” “partial upfront,” or “no upfront”). Dedicated hosts can 
be purchased as an on-demand instance or as a reservation for 
significant savings.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_244"></span>B,
 C. Reserved instances are the best option for steady-state applications
 and require at least a one-year commitment, which would point to 
options B and C.</li>
<li>D. Spot instances are not ideal for spikes in usage, as those instances may be terminated at any time.</li>
<li>B. In this scenario, you want to ensure that instances stay up 
(eliminating the spot market) and that there is no long-term commitment 
(eliminating reserved instances). Dedicated hosts don’t make sense, so 
this leaves on-demand instances.</li>
<li>A, B. The spot market provides instances that can stop and start at 
any time. Now, applications on these instances can be stopped and 
restarted (A). Additionally, costs are significantly lower than 
on-demand pricing (B). However, the hardware can change often, and 
spikes in usage are <i>not</i> well suited for spot instances.</li>
<li>D. On a pure “storage per GB” comparison, Amazon Glacier is the least expensive storage class.</li>
<li>A. S3-SSE is an encryption solution. Standard IA is infrequent 
access, RRS is reduced redundancy (and is now deprecated), and of course
 Glacier is a valid S3 storage class.</li>
<li>C. Uploading data is the textbook definition of ingress, and ingress never has associated fees.</li>
<li>A. It is always free to move data into CloudFront. There may be a 
cost associated with egress from CloudFront, but the transfer to 
CloudFront is cost-free.</li>
<li>B. The AWS free tier is <i>just AWS</i> but without a cost. You can 
use up to several limits of services (data transfer, compute, storage, 
etc.) at no cost within the AWS free tier.</li>
<li>D. The AWS marketplace offers free and paid software products, many 
of which run on the AWS free tier. You can find AMIs and services as 
well as many trial offerings from third parties.</li>
<li>D. AWS free tier offers almost everything that paid AWS does, simply at lesser volumes.</li>
<li>D. The four AWS support plans are basic, developer, business, and enterprise.</li>
<li>C, D. This should be pretty intuitive: The higher and more 
business-oriented levels of support offer 24/7 support; in this case, 
business and enterprise.</li>
<li>B. AWS Trusted Advisor is an online resource that helps you reduce 
cost as well as increase performance and improve security. However, it 
does not provide logging (C) or affect Auto Scaling limits or 
configuration.</li>
<li>C. There are five core Trusted Adviser checks: cost optimization, 
security, fault tolerance, performance, and service limits. Note: In 
some places, AWS will say that there are seven checks, but in others, 
five. The most current documentation indicates the five checks noted 
here.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_245"></span>A,
 B. AWS Trusted Advisor provides advice that typically is useful in all 
environments, for all use cases. In this set of answers, the two that 
meet that criteria are turning on MFA for the root account and avoiding 
global Internet access to an S3 bucket. These recommendations will apply
 to almost all situations. The other two options—C and D—are use-case 
specific and therefore would not be suggested by Trusted Advisor.</li>
<li>D. AWS Trusted Advisor makes recommendations about S3 bucket usage, 
IAM usage, and snapshots (both EBS and RDS) but does not make 
recommendations regarding DNS, so D is correct.</li>
<li>B. AWS Trusted Advisor makes recommendations in five categories: 
cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service 
limits.</li>
<li>A, D. AWS Trusted Advisor makes recommendations in five categories: 
cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service 
limits.</li>
<li>A, C. First, C is an easy choice: MFA on the root account is one of 
the most common recommendations. Then, consider the areas in which 
Trusted Advisor can make absolute recommendations; underuse of DNS 
records doesn’t make a lot of sense (how do you “underuse DNS?”) and 
coming up with the “correct” S3 storage class involves understanding use
 cases, which Trusted Advisor can’t do. This leaves A, idle load 
balancers.</li>
<li>A, B. AWS makes five standard recommendations: Right-size your 
services to meet capacity needs at the lowest cost, save money by 
reserving, use the spot market, monitor and track service usage, and use
 Cost Explorer to optimize savings.</li>
<li>C. AWS makes five standard recommendations: Right-size your services
 to meet capacity needs at the lowest cost, save money by reserving, use
 the spot market, monitor and track service usage, and use Cost Explorer
 to optimize savings. Using the spot market (C) falls into that last 
category. The other answers are all use-case driven and really don’t fit
 into general cost-saving recommendations.</li>
<li>C. This should be pretty basic: AWS Cost Explorer provides reports via analysis for evaluating your overall AWS costs over time.</li>
<li>B. This is largely a matter of recognizing the valid AWS tools—AWS 
Trusted Advisor and AWS Cost Explorer—and then determining which deals 
with costs. In this case, that’s AWS Cost Explorer.</li>
<li>B. Cost Explorer gives you reports on EC2 monthly cost and usage that can help analyze monthly spending on instances.</li>
<li>C. While AWS Cost Explorer can give you information about your 
monthly storage costs, AWS Budgets allows you to set alerts and then add
 custom programming to reduce or halt those costs.</li>
<li>D. This is an important question. None of the tools listed allow for
 actual “cutoffs” at cost thresholds. AWS Budgets allows you 
notifications when a threshold is met but does <i>not</i> allow you to cut off spending at a certain point on its own.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_246"></span>C. Elastic Transcoder allows you to produce media files that are optimized and well suited for various device types.</li>
<li>A. This question is as much about recognizing the various AWS 
service acronyms as anything. Here, RDS—the Relational Database 
Service—allows you to use Oracle on an AWS managed service.</li>
<li>A. Elastic Beanstalk can deploy your code and handle capacity 
provisioning, load balancing, and setting up Auto Scaling and health 
checks, all with very little oversight. Note that you’d still need 
personnel to keep an application like this running, but Elastic 
Beanstalk can reduce initial resources needed for application 
deployment.</li>
<li>B. CloudFormation allows you to automate provisioning and, in this 
case, to create standardized JSON scripts that can be lightly modified 
to stand up entire stacks for multiple applications that share a common 
structure.</li>
<li>D. Snowball is almost always the most cost-effective approach to 
data transfer when you approach 50 TB, and there are good reasons to 
consider it even at 10 TB or more.</li>
<li>A. Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage service and allows your on-premises data store to interact with S3.</li>
<li>C. Large data should always make you think, “Snowball.” Snowball 
gives you a reliable, scalable, petabyte-scale data transfer solution.</li>
<li>D. Redshift is AWS’s managed service for OLAP and business intelligence.</li>
<li>A. EMR, Elastic MapReduce, is a web service targeted at processing 
large amounts of data. It is optimized for this task and often provides 
cost savings over EC2 instances running similar processes.</li>
<li>A, D. QuickSight is a business analytics service, and Redshift is 
ideal for business intelligence and OLAP. While you could build 
high-performance applications using EC2 instances and provisioned IOPS 
EBS volumes, managed services like QuickSight and Redshift are almost 
always going to be more cost effective.</li>
<li>D. Both A and B are going to incur significant costs and custom 
code. C is not a bad option on the analytics side but will still likely 
require custom code to aggregate the data sources. QuickSight, however, 
is designed exactly for this task: combining data sources and then 
performing analytics and extracting insights.</li>
<li>C. Glacier is Amazon’s long-term data archival solution.</li>
<li>A. CloudFormation is ideal for automating deployment without manual 
intervention, but it’s actually Elastic Beanstalk that handles the <i>provisioning</i> of resources.</li>
<li>C. Kinesis is intended to handle streaming data sources. It collects
 and processes data from these streaming sources in real time and would 
be ideal to replace custom code that handles this same process, as the 
question asks.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_247"></span>A.
 Lambda allows you to “ignore” the underlying resources required for 
running code. You simply give Lambda the code to run, and Lambda will 
handle provisioning resources in a scalable and cost-effective manner.</li>
<li>D. CloudWatch provides monitoring of applications and is a low-cost solution for AWS monitoring.</li>
<li>A. CloudTrail is the AWS service for logging and is particularly helpful for auditing and compliance.</li>
<li>C. Almost all of these add unnecessary steps and involve multiple 
instances or either Oracle or PostgreSQL. The easiest, most 
cost-effective option is to migrate directly from Oracle to PostgreSQL 
using DMS, the Database Migration Service.</li>
<li>A. S3 is the AWS choice for durability and flat-file (non-relational data) storage.</li>
<li>A. IAM is the best option for handling users, groups, and permissions within AWS.</li>
<li>A, B. IAM is the best option for handling users, groups, and 
permissions within AWS. You can then add Cognito to offer single sign-on
 capabilities to your applications.</li>
<li>B. Trusted Advisor is a great start to find glaring holes or deficiencies in an AWS environment.</li>
<li>C. OpsWorks is a configuration management tool that actually can use
 Chef, so many of the existing modules would plug right in and existing

<li>B. AWS does guarantee that all SQS messages will be delivered <i>at least</i> once, but the message <i>may be</i>
 delivered more than once (making option A incorrect). This is not 
related to the number of requests to the queue or the applications using
 the queue; therefore, both C and D are incorrect. This leaves B, the 
correct answer.</li>
<li>B, C. This is a common question AWS often asks to ensure that you 
understand that managed services like RDS and DynamoDB are indeed 
completely <i>managed</i>: You cannot access the underlying operating 
system of the service. This leaves EC2 and EMR as the remaining, and

 “out of the box,” it still allows root level access, as do EC2

<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_248"></span>C.
 SQS queues have a visibility timeout that controls how long a message 
in the queue is marked as “invisible” while being processed. This 
accounts for the message “disappearing.” Then, if application processing
 fails—as in option C—the message is remarked as visible and is 
available for processing again. Option A correctly notes this timeout, 
but reducing the timeout would not cause the message to be processed 
correctly. It would just reduce the time that the message is 
“invisible.” Option B is not how queues work; they cannot ask a sender 
to resend a message. Option D is incorrect as well, as the queue is 
operating as intended with regard to visibility of messages and 
timeouts.</li>
<li>D. Snapshots are accessible through the console via username/password and through AWS CLI and APIs via application key.</li>
<li>B. SNS is the Simple Notification Service and functions like a 
mailer, sending out notifications that can be subscribed to by other 
applications.</li>
<li>A. SNS sends out notifications to subscribed listeners, and SWF 
pushes out messages as they arrive. Only SQS holds messages until the 
queue is polled. Redshift is not a messaging service at all but rather a
 data warehousing solution.</li>
<li>B. SNS and SWF operate on a push approach. SQS holds messages until they are pulled out of the queue. S3 is not a message store.</li>
<li>D. Both SWF and SQS deliver a message at least once, but only SWF guarantees that a message will <i>only</i> be delivered a single time.</li>
<li>B. Messages in SWF are tasks; messages in SQS are messages; messages
 in SNS are notifications. S3 is a storage solution, not a messaging 
solution.</li>
<li>C. Messages in SWF are tasks; messages in SQS are messages; messages
 in SNS are notifications. S3 is not a messaging solution at all.</li>
<li>D. Messages in SWF are tasks; messages in SQS are messages; messages
 in SNS are notifications. S3 is not a message store. Since SQS is not 
an option, the answer is D, none of these.</li>
<li>C. SWF is more than a simple queue. It automates workflow, moving a 
task (what SWF calls its messages) from one application component to the
 next in a predetermined order.</li>
<li>B. SWF is not exactly a true acronym. It stands for Simple Workflow Service but is not represented by SWS. Instead, the <i>WF</i> refers to <i>workflow</i>.</li>
<li>A, D. Both EC2 and ECS provide environments on which your custom 
code can run, and both are compute services. S3 is a storage service, 
and Redshift is a data warehousing solution. While Redshift can be 
helpful in analysis of data, it is not suitable for running custom 
scripts.</li>
<li>B. Of the choices available, Amazon Lightsail is the easiest 
solution for getting simple applications running quickly. EC2 and ECS 
are both much more complex. While S3 website hosting is a web hosting 
solution, it does require quite a bit of AWS knowledge (security, 
permissions, etc.).</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_249"></span>B,
 D. An EBS snapshot cannot be deleted if it is the root device of a 
registered AMI while that AMI is in use. You’ll need to deregister the 
AMI first (B), and then you can delete the EBS volume and any snapshots 
and stop using the AMI.</li>
<li>A. EBS is considered a subset of EC2 functionality. Therefore, you use the <span class="codeLabel">aws ec2</span> commands; for example, <span class="codeLabel">aws ec2 delete-snapshot</span>.</li>
<li>C. A records are used to point a specific domain or subdomain to an 
IP address. CNAMEs point to a different URL, which in turn can be 
resolved further by DNS. In this case, you’d want to create a CNAME 
record for <span class="codeLabel">applestoapples.com</span> and point that record to <span class="codeLabel">applestoapples.net</span>
 and then let DNS resolve that domain. Using an A record means you’d 
have to lock the record to a specific IP rather than the domain name for
 <span class="codeLabel">applestoapples.net</span>. That’s a problem, 
though, as over time, the domain may be served by different resources 
with different IP addresses, making the A record dated and incorrect.</li>
<li>A. A records are used to point a specific domain or subdomain to an 
IP address. CNAMEs point to URLs or other domain names. In this case, 
since you’re pointing at an ELB, you’d need to use a CNAME, as ELBs 
don’t expose a public IP address.</li>
<li>A. This is a little trickier in terms of picking the <i>best</i> 
answer. It is possible to set a CNAME up and point that at the ALB’s URL
 (B). However, AWS prefers that you use an A record and configure it as 
an alias record, allowing you to direct traffic to the ALB. This is 
different than a standard A record, which can only point at an IP 
address. Option C is incorrect because ALBs don’t expose an IP address, 
and D doesn’t even make sense in this context.</li>
<li>A. AWS supports zone apex records for all domains. A zone apex record is a DNS record at the root, or apex, of a DNS zone. So <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></span>
 is an apex record (sometimes called a naked domain record). Route 53 
absolutely will support zone apex records and allows alias records (of A
 type) at this level as well.</li>
<li>A, D. First, A is false. A zone apex record is a DNS record at the root, or apex, of a DNS zone. So <span class="codeLabel"><a href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></span>
 is an apex record (sometimes called a naked domain record). Route 53 
absolutely will support zone apex records and allows alias records (of A
 type) at this level as well. D is also false; Route 53 supports zone 
apex records for AWS and non-AWS domains and services.</li>
<li>A, D. Route 53 is scalable by design, so there are no steps required
 to make it highly available; this makes D true. Additionally, it 
supports all AWS services, including auto-scaling, so A is true.</li>
<li>D. By default, a single account can manage 50 domains using Route 
53. However, this is a default, and AWS will raise it pretty willingly 
if you call and explain your need for management of additional domains.</li>
<li>D. RDS is a managed system by AWS and does not allow any access to its underlying operating system.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_250"></span>C,
 D. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs but is not 
limited to a single region (so A is false) and is neither VPN nor 
gateway-based (so B is false). This leaves C and D, both of which are 
true: VPCs can be used to share data and can peer across regions.</li>
<li>B. AWS calls a connection between two VPCs via peering across regions an inter-region VPC peering connection.</li>
<li>C. When a VPC peering connection is set up, each VPC will need a route manually added to allow communication to the peered VPC.</li>
<li>D. Most of these statements are false: VPCs in different regions (A)
 and in different accounts (B) can be peered, and if both VPCs are in 
the same account, they can share a security group (C). However, two 
peered VPCs <i>cannot</i> have overlapping CIDR blocks (D).</li>
<li>B. A VPC can have multiple subnets, so a VPC peering relationship is a one-to-one relationship between two VPCs (B).</li>
<li>C. While it is true that transitive peering relationships are not 
allowed (A), you can still peer VPCs B and C to allow traffic to flow 
between the two VPCs.</li>
<li>B, C. VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks cannot be removed as is (B),
 and therefore the overlap must be removed (C). Changing either VPC to 
IPv6 <i>might</i> be a working solution (D) but is not a requirement.</li>
<li>A. Regardless of subnet, NACL, or any other networking 
consideration, you can only create one VPC connection between two VPCs 
at a time.</li>
<li>B. A VPC can be a part of an unlimited number of VPC connections, as
 long as those connections are all with different VPCs and you stay 
within AWS’s overall account limits. Only one peering connection between
 two specific VPCs is possible; for example, only one connection can 
exist between VPC A and VPC B. But VPC A can have as many peering 
connections–each with a different VPC–as there are VPCs with which you 
can connect.</li>
<li>C. Transitive VPC relationships are not allowed in AWS. Most of these answers are complete gibberish!</li>
<li>B, D. First, AWS does not support IPv6 inter-region communication. 
This means that for IPv6 communication to work, the two VPCs must be in 
the same region (D). Then, you must ensure that both VPCs have IPv6 
addresses and that routing is set up to use those addresses (B).</li>
<li>A, C. EC2-Classic was a flat network that offered very little in the
 way of multiple options. With VPCs, you can assign multiple IP 
addresses as well as multiple network interfaces (A and C).</li>
<li>A, D. Default VPCs come with both an internet gateway and public 
subnets. If you think through this, these two go hand in hand: A public 
subnet would need an internet gateway to function as public.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_251"></span>A,
 D. The default VPC has public subnets within it. Further, it provides a
 default routing table that provides access to and from these instances 
and the public Internet (A). Additionally, an internet gateway is added 
to the VPC by default (D).</li>
<li>C. Non-default subnets and their instances are not public by 
default. Therefore, they are assigned a private IPv4 address (C) rather 
than a public one.</li>
<li>B, C. Non-default subnets are private by default. Therefore, you 
need an internet gateway on the containing VPC (C) as well as giving the
 instance a public IP address (B). While a NAT instance <i>might</i> 
work (D), it would need to be in a different, public subnet rather than 
in the same subnet as the instance trying to reach the Internet.</li>
<li>D. SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language, allows you to 
provide federated single sign-on access to the AWS management console.</li>
<li>C. Remember that AWS provides a principle of least privilege and 
always wants to limit access to only what a user (or service) needs. 
Therefore, new IAM users do not have any access to AWS services and must
 be granted access to any service explicitly.</li>
<li>B. IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.</li>
<li>A, C. IAM users logging into the AWS console will need a username, 
password, and the sign-in URL. If the user needs access to AWS APIs or 
the SDK, then they will need their access key ID and secret access key. 
Keep in mind that these credential pairs are <i>not</i> interchangeable.</li>
<li>A. Of these groups, only the Administrator group provides write 
access to all AWS services. The Power User group provides access to 
developer-related services, but not <i>all</i> services (like IAM). The Support User group is for creating and viewing support cases.</li>
<li>D. New users will need a customized sign-in link for accessing the 
console (D). They will then use this link to sign in using their 
username and password.</li>
<li>B. There are two key parts to this question: the mobile client that 
must have an endpoint to which it can send data and the receiver for a 
huge amount of data, as the question indicates millions of users. Mobile
 SDK is a bit of a giveaway for the mobile component. This also 
helpfully narrows the answer choices down to A and B. Of the two 
options, Kinesis and EC2, only Kinesis is built to handle a massive data
 stream. While you could theoretically scale up enough EC2 instances to 
serve an API for that volume of requests, it really makes no sense. 
Kinesis is built for incoming data streams, so is the better option.</li>
<li>B. A new AWS account requires the company email (or account owner 
email) for the root account holder, or a generic email for the company 
as a whole.</li>
<li>A, D. Both the Administrators and the Power Users default policies 
provide read and write access to most AWS services. Power Users limits 
access to IAM, but that would not affect access to S3 or EC2.</li>
<li>C. A policy is AWS’s document type for describing a set of permissions.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_252"></span>B.
 ECS is the Elastic Container Service, AWS’s service for running 
applications in containers and managing the starting, stopping, and 
scaling of those containers.</li>
<li>C, D. Containers allow you to reduce startup times, as they are 
launched into already-running instances in most cases (C). This also 
touches on AWS’s facility to manage and provision the instances on which
 the containers run (D), another advantage. While you can scale 
applications in containers (A), you can just as easily scale 
applications on EC2 instances. Finally, option B is simply false.</li>
<li>A. The first thing here is to know these various acronyms. ECR is 
the Elastic Container Registry, ECS is the Elastic Container Service, 
EC2 is Elastic Compute Cloud, EMR is Elastic MapReduce, and of course S3
 is Simple Storage Service. Given that, only A has all the needed 
components: the registry (ECR), the management service (ECS), and 
instances on which to run containers (EC2). Note that even though you 
might not use EC2 explicitly for your containers, it or Fargate will be 
required to manage instances at some level, even if only by AWS for you.</li>
<li>C. You’ll need to know these various acronyms. ECR is the Elastic 
Container Registry, ECS is the Elastic Container Service, EMR is Elastic
 MapReduce, and S3 is Simple Storage Service. ECC isn’t an AWS acronym, 
so it is immediately out. Of those left, ECR, the Elastic Container 
Registry, is most closely associated with ECS.</li>
<li>B, C. Containers allow you to co-locate applications on instances 
and more effectively use your available instances without a lot of 
overhead, so B is true. C is in a similar vein: Containers reduce the 
management overhead of instances. A is not true, as containers don’t 
significantly change your cost structure, and D is false, as containers 
and instances can both scale up and down to meet demand.</li>
<li>A, D. Containers are applications (D) that scale based on 
application load (A). Lambda, in contrast, runs isolated pieces of code 
and not entire application tiers. Additionally, Lambda launches based on
 events rather than load. (Note that you could actually set up load 
monitors in CloudWatch and trigger Lambda based on load, although that 
is not automatic as it is in containers.)</li>

<section id="capp-sec-0006">
<h2><a id="usec0006"></a>Practice Test</h2>
<ol id="capp-list-0006">
<li>A, C. First, a larger instance with the fastest possible volume 
type—provisioned IOPS—is generally going to improve overall performance,
 so A is a good idea. Second, ElastiCache will provide faster responses 
and reduce database reads over time. A and C are both valid approaches. A
 Multi-AZ setup is for disaster recovery, and sharding is high overhead 
and could potentially increase response time, rather than reduce it, in 
this use case.</li>
<li>B. redis and memcached are engines available for use by ElastiCache.
 reddit is an online information site, and Redshift is a data 
warehousing and OLAP service.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_253"></span>B,
 C. AWS allows a number of options for encrypting data at rest. In the 
supplied solutions, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is an AWS-managed 
solution for data encryption, and customer-provided keys are allowed as 
well. In the latter case, customers provide the keys and AWS handles 
encryption of data using those keys. ElastiCache for memcached does not 
support encryption and, further, is not a solution for encrypting data 
but instead a caching service. AWS Encryptic is not an actual AWS 
service.</li>
<li>A, D. AWS Organizations allows the management of multiple accounts 
in one place and allows tracking of those individual accounts (D). 
Additionally, in many cases, AWS will allow discounts based on total 
services used rather than treating each account individually (A).</li>
<li>B, C. The biggest issue here is that all the users are using the 
root account, meaning there’s a shared password and that users have far 
more permissions than they should. These can both be addressed by 
creating new IAM users for each user (B) and putting those users in 
predefined groups according to their job function (C). Developers don’t 
need access to IAM in general, so D is incorrect, and while changing the
 root password is a good idea, A is also incorrect because a financial 
manager (and possibly support engineers) may not need the AWS CLI as 
their access mechanism.</li>
<li>D. The best choice for I/O intensive applications and databases is 
provisioned IOPS (D). The only other potentially confusing option is B, 
throughput optimized HDD. These are not SSD volumes, and they are better
 for data warehousing rather than intensive I/O.</li>
<li>B, C. There are two potential problems here: network throughput and 
failed transmissions not being retried. Solution B addresses throughput 
by increasing the ability of the NAT instance to handle large amounts of
 data from multiple instances. Solution C addresses failed transmissions
 by treating them as a problem that should be retried by instances.</li>
<li>A, B. You cannot encrypt an existing EBS volume (A). Additionally, 
once a snapshot is encrypted, you cannot create an unencrypted copy of 
that snapshot (B). You can attach encrypted volumes to instances (C), 
and you can create an encrypted volume from an unencrypted snapshot (D).</li>
<li>C. First, realize that when you see a question asking about writing 
to S3, you want a URL that is not set up for static website hosting. 
This means that the bucket name follows the trailing slash and is not 
part of the domain itself. This means that B and C are the only valid 
options. Then, remember that the service (s3) and the region (in this 
case, eu-west-2) are <i>not</i> separated by a dot delimiter, but instead a dash. This leaves C as the correct answer.</li>
<li>C. CloudWatch is the AWS preferred solution for monitoring events. 
While data from flow logs could be handled by RDS and analyzed by 
Redshift, neither of these are as targeted a solution for monitoring as 
CloudWatch.</li>
<li>C. Lambda is best for writing custom code without the overhead of 
provisioning EC2 instances, so both A and C are potentially correct 
answers. While SQS does offer queuing of code, SWF (the Simple Workflow 
Service) offers you prebuilt tracking of application-level events and 
tasks. Attach Lambda to this and you have a ready-to-use event-driven 
service.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_254"></span>B,
 D. Non-default VPCs do not have an internet gateway attached, so B 
provides that remedy. Attaching an internet gateway to the VPC will 
provide public instances with a path out to the Internet. Solution D is 
also correct; NACLs on non-default VPCs will not allow HTTP or HTTPS 
traffic in (nor will security groups, for that matter) and need to 
explicitly allow in HTTP/S traffic.</li>
<li>D. Most of these answers will not help the problem. The NAT instance
 should be in a public subnet, so A is not useful. The EBS volume of the
 NAT can be an issue, but not in providing Internet access for 
connecting instances (B). The subnet containing the EC2 instances using 
the NAT instance should be private, so C is both incorrect and a bad 
design decision. This leaves D: NAT instances must have 
Source/Destination Check disabled to function properly.</li>
<li>D. All S3 storage classes share the same durability: 11 9s 
(99.999999999%). That’s often unintuitive, so it’s best to recall that 
all S3 classes have durability in common and decrease in availability 
from S3 to S3-IA to S3 One Zone-IA.</li>
<li>C. The keys here are that cost is a driver and that the image 
processing code is fast and inexpensive. That effectively means that if 
images were lost after processing, they could be reprocessed without 
affecting the overall system cost. As a result, it’s possible to pick an
 S3 class where images post-processing might be lost, <i>if</i> that 
results in a lower overall cost. This allows for S3 One Zone-IA, the 
cheapest of the provided S3 classes aside from Glacier, which has load 
times much longer than would be acceptable. S3 One Zone-IA might lose 
your processed images, but since they can easily be re-created, this 
isn’t a deterrent.</li>
<li>C. EFS, the Elastic File System, is effectively a NAS in the cloud 
and can provide storage accessible to multiple EC2 instances at one 
time.</li>
<li>C, D. Non-default VPCs do not have an internet gateway attached and 
will need one to host any public subnets, so C is required. Then, with 
the internet gateway attached, instances within the subnet will need a 
route through this gateway for Internet traffic (D).</li>
<li>A, B. AWS defines several custom request headers, and all begin with
 x-amz rather than x-aws. This will help you eliminate incorrect 
answers; in this case, it means that A is valid and C is not. Then, 
you’ll simply have to memorize the other request headers; Content-Length
 (C) is valid, while Content-Size (D) is not.</li>
<li>A, C. There are four AWS support levels: basic, developer, business,
 and enterprise. Neither professional nor corporate is a valid support 
level.</li>
<li>B, D. RDS supports a number of database options: MariaDB, Aurora, 
PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. DynamoDB is not a relational 
database, and DB2 is not supported.</li>
<li>B. Scaling in is the process by which an Auto Scaling group removes instances. You can think of scaling in as “moving <i>in</i> the boundaries of the group” and scaling out as “moving <i>out</i> the boundaries of the group.” Of the available choices, only B—5 instances—represents a reduction of instances.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_255"></span>B, D. CloudFormation templates can be written in JSON and YAML.</li>
<li>C. Only geolocation routing will ensure that the location of the 
user is the primary factor. While latency-based routing would seem to 
translate to location-based, it is conceivable that network traffic to a
 nearby region could cause latency to be lower for a user in (for 
example) Australia to be routed to US regions. Therefore, only 
geolocation routing would ensure that the closest region geographically 
is used by the major user bases.</li>
<li>C. A CNAME record allows you to direct traffic to a DNS name, and in
 this case, that DNS name would be the ELB. ELBs do not provide an IP 
address, so an A record would not work. An MX record is for email, and 
an AAAA record is for IPv6 addresses.</li>
<li>A, C. The key here is that you are not creating new users (and B is 
therefore incorrect); instead, you need to use an existing Active 
Directory setup. That requires an identity provider (A). Then, you can 
issue temporary tokens (C) to get users started, and they can update 
credentials from there.</li>
<li>D. This is a question with a relatively easy answer, but lots of red
 herring answers as well. When you have a specific recurring traffic 
period, scheduled scaling is an easy solution (D). All the other options
 are much more complex and may not work at all.</li>
<li>D. DynamoDB is a prototypical example of an AWS managed service. It 
handles its resources and does not provide controls for these to the 
user (answer D). In the case of proactivity, DynamoDB and AWS will 
handle scaling up. Additionally, DynamoDB already uses SSDs and multiple
 instances, without user intervention.</li>
<li>B. The default settings for CloudWatch specify a 5-minute interval at which metrics are collected.</li>
<li>B, C. The issue here is CPU, which you can essentially convert in 
your head to “too many things are being asked of the database at one 
time.” The easiest way to reduce CPU on any database is to decrease 
requests and reads, and both an ElastiCache instance and read replicas 
do just that: reduce load on the primary database instance.</li>
<li>A. The Simple Workflow Service is ideal for tasks that need to 
execute based on steps within an application. Additionally, SWF has 
hooks built into applications that you get automatically without custom 
infrastructure code.</li>
<li>B. SQS queues in standard configuration are FIFO, but ordering is 
not guaranteed. If ordering must be preserved, the queue should be set 
as a FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue (B). With a LIFO queue (D), 
ordering is reversed and wouldn’t meet the requirements of the question.</li>
<li>C. Route 53 has a number of valid routing policies: simple, 
failover, geolocation, geoproximity, latency-based, multivalue answer, 
and weighted. Of the provided answers, only load-balancing is not valid.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_256"></span>D.
 The only potentially useful answers here are B and D: you need more 
processing power to handle requests, and you need to deal with 
nonresponsive instances at peak times. The spot market will do nothing 
to help here, and pre-warming the load balancer will still not handle 
traffic when that traffic is sudden and produces a large spike. Of B and
 D, only D addresses nonresponsiveness. By having requests go to a 
queue, you should not have users experience a nonresponsive application 
at all; the SQS queue will scale as needed, and then instances can 
handle requests as they become available in the queue.</li>
<li>A, B. Processes suitable for the spot market must be able to run at 
any time (B) because the spot market makes instances available 
unpredictably, and the process must be able to stop and start and 
continue work (A) because spot instances can stop at any time.</li>
<li>D. All of the S3 storage classes offer 11 9s of durability (99.999999999%).</li>
<li>A, C. EBS uses block-level storage, while S3 uses object-based 
storage (A). Additionally, EBS volumes by default are deleted when the 
attached instance is stopped. While this can be changed, it does result 
in EBS volumes being ephemeral by default, as compared with S3, which 
does not disappear by default.</li>
<li>B. The key here is the requirement to manage costs. Option C is not 
cost-effective, as it requires expensive Oracle licenses. Option D is 
going to require larger instances, which will also incur new costs. 
Option A might be effective, but running a custom database installation 
will likely cost more than RDS and also incur significant overhead 
costs. Only option C provides an “in-place” cost option. Aurora 
typically outperforms MySQL in an apples-to-apples comparison, although 
there will be some overhead in migrating from MySQL to Aurora.</li>
<li>C, D. Both ELBs (elastic load balancers) and DynamoDB provide fault 
tolerance, and ELBs provide load balancing. Further, both services are 
automatically redundant without user intervention. Lightsail and AWS 
Organizations are services used for deployment and management of AWS 
rather than for providing redundancy and high availability.</li>
<li>A, D. EC2 instances are not automatically redundant; you would need 
to do additional work as the architect to ensure that applications on 
EC2 instances are redundant across AZs. While RDS as a service is fault 
tolerant, it is not automatically highly available. A Multi-AZ setup 
would address that need, for example. On the contrary, both S3 (B) and 
SQS (C) are automatically highly available across availability zones.</li>
<li>D. AWS does not allow vulnerability scans to be run without advance 
notice. There are some preapproved scans using AWS-approved tools, but 
in general, you’ll need to contact your AWS account manager or support 
team in advance of running vulnerability scans.</li>
<li>A, D. Although cost is an important factor, the solutions here would
 remain the same even if it were not explicitly mentioned. First, an SQS
 queue is ideal for capturing what needs to be accomplished, independent
 of running queries. That queue will need to be accessible from EC2 
instances that will run those queries. Additionally, spot instances are 
ideal for long-running queries that can be interrupted and restarted. 
Even better, the spot market also addresses the cost concerns mentioned 
in the question.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_257"></span>D.
 Spot instances terminate when the maximum set bid price is reached. 
Increasing the bid price will effectively raise the threshold for 
termination, causing them to run longer. This will cost more but, 
overall, keeps the application design intact.</li>
<li>B. A cached volume gateway stores your data in S3 while caching 
frequently accessed data. While a stored volume gateway would keep all 
data locally, it would not address the on-site storage costs mentioned 
in the question.</li>
<li>C. Network access control lists (NACLs) and security groups are the 
primary mechanisms within AWS that replace traditional firewalls.</li>
<li>A, C. By default, AWS creates a VPC with a public subnet, and that 
subnet by definition must have an internet gateway. NAT devices 
(instances and gateways) and virtual private gateways must explicitly be
 set up and are not created by AWS by default.</li>
<li>B. Auto Scaling groups scale in using a very specific set of 
criteria. Highest priority is the availability zone with the most 
instances, then the age of the launch configuration of instances, and 
finally, the nearness of instances to the next billing hour.</li>
<li>B. This is a tough question, and right on the edges of what might be
 asked on the exam. Hardware virtualization is fully virtualized 
(compared to “para” virtualization, partly virtualized) and therefore 
works with all instance types (making C false) and all hardware 
extensions (making B true). Since B is advantageous for hardware 
virtualization, it is the correct answer.</li>
<li>A. Provisioned IOPS is the fastest class of drive for high 
performance. It is built upon SSD (solid-state drives) and provides 
mission-critical low-latency workloads.</li>
<li>A. Changes to security groups take place immediately, regardless of 
whether the updates affect instances, ELBs, or any other AWS constructs.</li>
<li>C. A read replica would provide an additional database instance to 
service the queries (C). A Multi-AZ setup handles failover (B), and the 
secondary instance would not be in service normally. Adding memory would
 not address the CPU issue (A). The implicit assumption here is that the
 data requested and processed each night is new data, so an ElastiCache 
instance (D) would have little to cache and therefore affect little.</li>
<li>C. Only the bucket owner of an S3 bucket can completely delete a file once versioning has been enabled.</li>
<li>B. While in many cases SSE-S3 is perfectly adequate (C), the 
additional auditing and compliance requirements indicate that SSE-KMS is
 a better option (B). Anytime you see a need for audit trails, you 
should think KMS. This is a common exam question, so memorize the 
association between auditing and KMS and you’ll probably get a free 
correct answer out of it!</li>
<li>B. Read replicas are updated asynchronously (B), and this is not 
configurable (so C is not an option). While network latency could be an 
issue (D), you still won’t be able to avoid the occasional lag in 
updating due to asynchronous replication.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="Page_258"></span>C. You can create 100 buckets in a single AWS account before you need to contact AWS support and ask for a limit increase.</li>
<li>B. There is no requirement to use an elastic IP in creating a public
 subnet. It is just as possible to create public IP addresses for 
instances in the subnet without using elastic IPs. However, you do need 
an internet gateway and routes to that gateway for Internet traffic.</li>
<li>C. The SSD volumes types, as well as optimized HDD and cold HDD, can all be as large as 16TiB.</li>
<li>A. Only A is false: You cannot attach multiple EC2 instances to a single EBS volume at one time.</li>
<li>D. This one should be pretty simple: RDS is a Relational Database Service and does not use key-value pairs.</li>
<li>A, B. The HDD options for EBS are generally less expensive than SSD 
options, so anytime lowering cost is a priority, HDD options are ideal; 
this makes A a valid answer. Data throughput for a throughput optimized 
HDD is actually greater than that of a general-purpose SSD (HDDs can go 
up to 500 MiB/s versus only 160 MiB/s on General Purpose SSDs), so B is 
another valid answer. Performance-critical workloads (answer C) are best
 served by provisioned IOPS SSDs, and the environment is not a factor in
 this case (answer D).</li>
<li>D. Of these options, only InnoDB is not supported by RDS.</li>
<li>A, C. AWS automatically creates a public subnet with new accounts. 
This public subnet will have instances that are public by default (A) 
via public IP addresses, but those IPs are <i>not</i> elastic IPs (so B 
is false). The instances will all access the Internet through an 
internet gateway (C), but the containing VPC will not have a virtual 
private gateway attached (so D is false).</li>
<li>A, D. Classic load balancers do support HTTP and HTTPS, but they do 
not support SSH or any flavor of FTP that does not use HTTP (or HTTPS) 
as an underlying protocol.</li>
<li>C. RRS, or reduced redundancy storage, is the predecessor to One 
Zone-IA but is less durable and currently deprecated. However, it can 
still show up on exams at odd times. Both its durability and 
availability are 99.99%. Another way to recall this is to note that all 
current S3 classes of storage have 11 9s durability, leaving only S3-RRS
 as a possibility here.</li>
<li>B, C. Delete protection is best accomplished through versioning and MFA Delete. Also note this is a rare time when the word <i>audit</i> does <i>not</i> pair with KMS as encryption is never discussed in the question.</li>
<li>B. If you know that you will use instances over a long period, 
reserved instances are always going to be cheaper than on-demand 
instances. Spot instances, however, will start and stop often and are 
not candidates for steady usage.</li>
